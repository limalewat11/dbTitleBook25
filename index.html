Creswell draws on years of teaching, writing, and conducting his own projects to offer effective techniques and procedures with many applied examples from research design, qualitative inquiry, and mixed methods.&nbsp;Creswell defines what a skill is, and acknowledges that while there may be more than 30 that an individual will use and perfect, the skills presented in this book are crucial for a new qualitative researcher starting a qualitative project.</p></p><p><p><strong>John W.

Britt<br><br>"This book is innovative, written following a conversational style, and provides excellent current references and connections to other authors&#x2019; work in the field of qualitative research. The book provides ideas for activities and further learning . . . This&nbsp;book will provide opportunities for having in-class discussions about topics that are not currently discussed in the existent textbooks such as managing difficult emotions that come up during research and anticipating ethical issues and preparing for the unexpected." -- Clarena Larrotta<br><br>"[This book] acts as an overview of the landscape of qualitative work rather than an in-depth treatment of specific research designs or analytic strategies . . . First, the author provides a logical progression of concepts and applications for novice qualitative researchers. Second, these concepts are treated with clear prose and sufficient examples. Third, readers are directed to further (and more in-depth) scholarly reading to learn more about the concepts in each chapter. Fourth, the scope of the book moves a novice from &#x2018;thinking like a qualitative researcher&#x2019; to considerations of scholarly venue analysis and placement for completed research."<br> -- Brian McNely<br><br>"[This book] is a comforting text. I would give it to every new grad student before they even took a qualitative research class&#x2015;it&#x2019;s a great primer, and it will ease the anxiety that arises when a student first engages in research methods in a scholarly way."<br> -- Andrew W. Ishak</p><h2>Xenophon: Anabasis (Loeb Classical Library) (English and Greek Edition)</h2><p><p>Xenophon (ca. 430 to ca. 354 BCE) was a wealthy Athenian and friend of Socrates. He left Athens in 401 and joined an expedition including ten thousand Greeks led by the Persian governor Cyrus against the Persian king. After the defeat of Cyrus, it fell to Xenophon to lead the Greeks from the gates of Babylon back to the coast through inhospitable lands. Later he wrote the famous vivid account of this 'March Up-Country' (<i>Anabasis</i>); but meanwhile he entered service under the Spartans against the Persian king, married happily, and joined the staff of the Spartan king, Agesilaus. But Athens was at war with Sparta in 394 and so exiled Xenophon. The Spartans gave him an estate near Elis where he lived for years writing and hunting and educating his sons. Reconciled to Sparta, Athens restored Xenophon to honour but he preferred to retire to Corinth.</p><p>Xenophon's Anabasis is a true story of remarkable adventures. <i>Hellenica,</i> a history of Greek affairs from 411 to 362, begins as a continuation of Thucydides' account. There are four works on Socrates (collected in Volume IV of the Loeb Xenophon edition). In <i>Memorabilia</i> Xenophon adds to Plato's picture of Socrates from a different viewpoint. The <i>Apology</i> is an interesting complement to Plato's account of Socrates' defense at his trial. Xenophon's <i>Symposium</i> portrays a dinner party at which Socrates speaks of love; and <i>Oeconomicus</i> has him giving advice on household management and married life. <i>Cyropaedia,</i> a historical romance on the education of Cyrus (the Elder), reflects Xenophon's ideas about rulers and government; the Loeb edition is in two volumes.</p><p>We also have his <i>Hiero,</i> a dialogue on government; <i>Agesilaus,</i> in praise of that king; <i>Constitution of Lacedaemon</i> (on the Spartan system); <i>Ways and Means</i> (on the finances of Athens); <i>Manual for a Cavalry Commander;</i> a good manual of <i>Horsemanship;</i> and a lively <i>Hunting with Hounds. The Constitution of the Athenians,</i> though clearly not by Xenophon, is an interesting document on politics at Athens. These eight books are collected in the last of the seven volumes of the Loeb Classical Library edition of Xenophon.</p></p><p><p>Carleton Lewis Brownson (1866&#x2013;1948) was Professor of Classical Languages at the City College of New York.</p><p>John Dillery is Professor of Classics at the University of Virginia.</p>Text: English, Greek (translation)<br> Original Language: Greek</p><h2>Legislation and Statutory Interpretation, 2d (Concepts and Insights)</h2><p>Suitable for students or practitioners, this authoritative overview of the legislative process and statutory interpretation moves smoothly and understandably between the theoretical and the practical. It contains in-depth discussion of such topics as theories of legislation and representation, electoral and legislative structures, extrinsic sources for statutory interpretation, and substantive canons of statutory interpretation.

It contains 940 basic signs presented topically, a method especially suited to beginning signers.<br><br> The organization of the volume facilitates learning. It provides a basic, functional sign vocabulary; a systematic progression in the use of the 14 sign markers; discussion of the unique features of a manual English system; a glossary of terms; and a page of exercises following each of the 12 chapters in the book. The words have been selected to be of most value to young children.</p><p><b>Harry Bornstein</b> is former director of the Gallaudet Signed English Project and is now a consultant in San Francisco, CA.<br><br><b>Karen L.

Stressing Plato's desire to stimulate philosophical thinking in his readers, Julia Annas here demonstrates the coherence of his main moral argument on the nature of justice, and expounds related concepts of education, human motivation, knowledge and understanding. In a clear systematic fashion, this book shows that modern moral philosophy still has much to learn from Plato's attempt to move the focus from questions of what acts the just person ought to perform to the more profound questions of what sort of person the just person ought to be.<br></p><p>Julia Annas is at University of Arizona, Tucson.<br>"Can be warmly recommended to teachers of the <em>Republic</em>....Annas' book, with its candor and skillful treatment of the issues, will add freshness and excitement to the study of the <em>Republic</em>; it will also provide students with an excellent model of philosophical scholarship."--<em>Teaching Philosophy</em><p></p><br>"It is obvious that many years of study and teaching of Plato's treatise lie behind her account. Only a first-rate philosopher can bring difficult passages in the <em>Republic</em> to life; Annas us equal to the task."--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"This book is likely to be of value to readers of the <em>Republic</em> regardless of the degree of familiarity with the text. On the one hand, it provides an accessible introduction. With a minimum of technical language, Annas systematically takes the reader through the <em>Republic</em>, showing how the various problems with which Plato is concerned frequently run deeper than first appearances suggest. And she is careful to tie the array of issues taken up to Plato's basic objectives, thereby revealing the remarkable coherence of the text itself. But this book is more than just an introduction. Those interested in the more technical aspects of the text will find a fountain of fresh ideas in Annas's discussions. Drawing on (and frequently taking issue with) many of the recent contributions to this area of Platonic studies, Annas develops novel and intriguing approaches to those aspects of the <em>Republic</em> often found so vexing."--<em>The Philosophical Review</em><p></p><br>"Reading this is as exhilarating for the mind as rock climbing is for the body."--Dennis Lamb, Professor of English, <em>Edmonds Community College</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Introduction to Engineering Technology</h2><p><p> <i>Introduction to Engineering Technology, Eighth Edition,</i> explains the responsibilities of technicians and technologists in the dynamic world of engineering.

A Polar wind blows through it, and birds of prey hover over it." In part, <i>Moby-Dick</i> is the story of an eerily compelling madman pursuing an unholy war against a creature as vast and dangerous and unknowable as the sea itself. But more than just a novel of adventure, more than an encyclopedia of whaling lore and legend, <i>Moby-Dick </i>is a haunting, mesmerizing, and important social commentary populated with several of the most unforgettable and enduring characters in literature. Written with wonderfully redemptive humor, <i>Moby-Dick</i> is a profound and timeless inquiry into character, faith, and the nature of perception. <br>&nbsp;</p><p>Burt Reynolds reading this story brings expression, meaning and action to the chase of a lifetime.

Guthrie has written a survey of the great age of Greek philosophy&#x2014;from Thales to Aristotle&#x2014;which combines comprehensiveness with brevity. Without pre-supposing a knowledge of Greek or the Classics, he sets out to explain the ideas of Plato and Aristotle in the light of their predecessors rather than their successors, and to describe the characteristic features of the Greek way of thinking and outlook on the world. Thus <em>The Greek Philosophers</em> provides excellent background material for the general reader&#x2014;as well as providing a firm basis for specialist studies. </p></p><p>W.K.C. Guthrie was formerly Laurence Professor of Ancient Philosophy in the University of Cambridge.&#34;Admirably fulfills its aim of explaining the development of Greek thought and Greek ways of thinking to the reader or student, who, while lacking knowledge of Greek, yet wants to learn something about the philosophers whose ideas have coloured and influenced European culture.&#34;-- &#34;The Times (London) Literary Supplement&#34;&#34; . . . The student who reads the work carefully will obtain a clear, coherent and balanced idea of the earlier cosmologies, of the humanistic reaction in the second half of the fifth century, B.C., and of the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle.&#34;-- Frederick C.

This book contains letters from all sorts of people - from other midwives to lorry drivers - responding to the books and telling their own stories. There are also writings by Jennifer herself, a biographical introduction by family members and a foreword by Miranda Hart.</p><p>Jennifer Worth trained as a nurse at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, and was later ward sister at the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital in London, then the Marie Curie Hospital, also in London. Music had always been her passion, and in 1973 she left nursing in order to study music intensively, teaching piano and singing for about 25 years. Jennifer died in May 2011 after a short illness, leaving her husband Philip, two daughters and three grandchildren. Her books have all been bestsellers.Jennifer Worth, author of the bestselling Call the Midwife, sadly passed away in May 2011 following a short illness. Her books have gained a great deal of popularity in recent years with their mixture of warmth, sadness and humour based on her experiences working as a midwife in the East End of London. Letters to the Midwife features some of the treasured letters received by Worth from former work colleagues and fans of her books. The resulting book is a rich testament to a life lived fully and to a very special lady whose memories have managed to inspire and touch so many * www.thebookbag.co.uk * Fans of the four Call the Midwife books that inspired the TV series will treasure this collection of letters to and from the author, Jennifer Worth, who passed away in 2011. Her tales of life in 1950s East End London inspired others to share their experiences of nursing at the time, along with responses from people from all walks of life. Perhaps most moving are the notes from Sister Jocelyn (known as Sister Julienne in the books), offering words of wisdom. * WOMAN *</p><h2>August Heat: An Inspector Montalbano Mystery</h2><p><b><b>&#x201c;The novels of Andrea Camilleri breathe out the sense of place, the sense of humor, and the sense of despair that fills the air of Sicily.&#x201d; &#x2014;Donna Leon&nbsp;</b><br></b><br>When a colleague extends his summer vacation, Inspector Salvo Montalbano is forced to stay in Vig�ta and endure the August heat. Montalbano's long-suffering girlfriend, Livia, joins him with a friend&#x2014;husband and young son in tow&#x2014;to keep her company during these dog days of summer. But when the boy suddenly disappears into a narrow shaft hidden under the family's beach rental, Montalbano, in pursuit of the child, uncovers something terribly sinister. As the inspector spends the summer trying to solve this perplexing case, Livia refuses to answer his calls-and Montalbano is left to take a plunge that will affect the rest of his life. <br><br>Fans of the Sicilian inspector as well as readers new to the popular series will enjoy following the melancholy but unflinchingly moral Montalbano as he undertakes one of the most shocking investigations of his career.</p><p><b>Andrea Camilleri</b>&nbsp;is the bestselling author of the popular Inspector Montalbano Mystery series, as well as a number of historical novels that take place in Sicily. He lives in Italy.<br><br><b>Stephen Sartarelli</b>&nbsp;is an award-winning translator and poet who lives in France.Camilleri&#x2019;s alternately brooding and life-loving Sicilian police inspector Salvo Montalbano may be the most agonizingly human lead character in the mystery genre. The inspector&#x2019;s all-too-recognizable shortcomings, from lethargy to lust,&nbsp;are on view in this latest episode in which a summer rental&#x2014;procured by Salvo for friends of his girlfriend, Livia&#x2014;becomes a kind of Italian Amityville horror. If an insect infestation isn&#x2019;t enough to turn the holiday into a fiasco, the body found in a concealed basement apartment does the trick nicely, leaving Montalbano on the outs with Livia and forced to contend with a six-year-old murder. As the inspector endures the August heat (often by sitting in his office in his underwear), he faces an even more formidable obstacle: his overwhelming attraction to the victim&#x2019;s stunning twin sister. Montalbano&#x2019;s various weaknesses lead directly to the troubling finale, leaving him forced&nbsp;to, yes, strip off his clothes one more time and dive into the sea, hoping to swim away his regrets. Combine the movies Body Heat and The Seven-Year Itch, blending the noir of the former with the farce of the latter, and you have something like this beguiling tragicomedy. --Bill Ott</p><h2>The Half-Drowned King: A Novel (The Golden Wolf Saga, 1)</h2><p><p><strong>"Linnea Hartsuyker brings myth and legend roaring to life in this superbly good page-turning saga of Viking-era Norway.

He lives in Davis, California<i>Chapter One<br></i><br>By the time Phil Chase was elected president, the world&#x2019;s climate was already far along the way to irrevocable change. There were already four hundred parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and another hundred parts would be there soon if civilization continued to burn its fossil carbon&#x2013;and at this point there was no other option. Just as Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected in the midst of a crisis that in some ways worsened before it got better, they were entangled in a moment of history when climate change, the destruction of the natural world, and widespread human misery were combining in a toxic and combustible mix. The new president had to contemplate drastic action while at the same time being constrained by any number of economic and politic factors, not least the huge public debt left deliberately by the administrations preceding him.<br><br>It did not help that the weather that winter careened wildly from one extreme to another, but was in the main almost as cold as the previous record-breaking year. Chase joked about it everywhere he went: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s ten below zero, aren&#x2019;t you glad you elected me? Just think what it would have been like if you hadn&#x2019;t!&#x201d; He would end speeches with a line from the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley:<br><br>&#x201c;O, Wind, if Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe it can,&#x201d; Kenzo pointed out with a grin. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re in the Youngest Dryas, after all.&#x201d;<br><br>In any case, it was a fluky winter&#x2013;above all windy&#x2013;and the American people were in an uncertain state of mind. Chase addressed this: &#x201c;The only thing we have to <i>fear</i>,&#x201d; he would intone, &#x201c;is abrupt climate change!&#x201d;<br><br>He would laugh, and people would laugh with him, understanding him to be saying that there was indeed something real to fear, but that they could do something about it.<br><br>His transition team worked with an urgency that resembled desperation. Sea level was rising; temperatures were rising; there was no time to lose. Chase&#x2019;s good humor and casual style were therefore welcomed, when they were not reviled&#x2013;much as it had been with FDR in the previous century. He would say, &#x201c;We got ourselves into this mess and we can get out of it. The problems create an opportunity to remake our relationship to nature, and create a new dispensation. So&#x2013;happy days are here again! Because we&#x2019;re making history, we are <i>seizing</i> the planet&#x2019;s history, I say, and turning it to the good.&#x201d;<br><br>Some scoffed; some listened and took heart; some waited to see what would happen.<br>As far as Frank Vanderwal&#x2019;s personal feelings were concerned, there was something reassuring about the world being so messed up. It tended to make his own life look like part of a trend, and a small part at that. A hill of beans in this world. Perhaps even so small as to be manageable.<br><br>Although, to tell the truth, it didn&#x2019;t feel that way. There were reasons to be very concerned, almost to the edge of fear. Frank&#x2019;s friend Caroline had disappeared on election night, chased by armed agents of some superblack intelligence agency. She had stolen her husband&#x2019;s plan to steal the election, and Frank had passed this plan to a friend at NSF with intelligence contacts, to what effect he could not be sure. He had helped her to escape her pursuers. To do that he had had to break a date with another friend, his boss and a woman he loved&#x2013;although what that meant, given the passionate affair he was carrying on with Caroline, he did not know. There was a lot he didn&#x2019;t know; and he could still taste blood at the back of his throat, months after his nose had been broken. He could not think for long about the same thing. He was living a life that he called parcellated, but others might call dysfunctional: i.e., semi-homeless in Washington, D.C. He could have been back home in San Diego by now, where his teaching position was waiting for him. Instead he was a temporary guest of the embassy of the drowned nation of Khembalung. But hey, everyone had problems! Why should he be any different?<br><br>Although brain damage would be a little more than different. Brain damage meant something like&#x2013;mental illness. It was a hard phrase to articulate when thinking about oneself. But it was possible his injury had exacerbated a lifelong tendency to make poor decisions. It was hard to tell. He had thought all his recent decisions had been correct, after all, in the moment he had made them. Should he not have faith that he was following a valid line of thought? He wasn&#x2019;t sure.<br><br>Thus it was a relief to think that all these personal problems were as nothing compared to the trouble all life on Earth now faced as a functioning biosphere. There were days in which he welcomed the bad news, and he saw that other people were doing the same. As this unpredictable winter blasted them with cold or bathed them in Carribbean balm, there grew in the city a shared interest and good cheer, a kind of solidarity.<br>Frank felt this solidarity also on the premises of the National Science Foundation, where he and many of his colleagues were trying to deal with the climate problem. To do so, they had to keep trying to understand the environmental effects of:<br><br>1)the so-far encouraging but still ambiguous results of their North Atlantic salting operation;<br><br>2)the equally ambiguous proliferation of a genetically modified &#x201c;fast tree lichen&#x201d; that had been released by the Russians in the Siberian forest;<br><br>3)the ongoing rapid detachment and flotation of the coastal verge of the Western Antarctic Ice Sheet;<br><br>4)the ongoing introduction of about nine billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year, ultimate source of many other problems;<br><br>5)the ensuing uptake of some three billion tons of carbon into the oceans;<br><br>6)the continuing rise of the human population by some hundred million people a year; and, lastly,<br><br>7)the cumulative impacts of all these events, gnarled together in feedback loops of all kinds.<br>It was a formidable list, and Frank worked hard on keeping his focus on it.<br><br>But he was beginning to see that his personal problems&#x2013;especially Caroline&#x2019;s disappearance, and the election-tampering scheme she had been tangled in&#x2013;were not going to be things he could ignore. They pressed on his mind.<br><br>She had called the Khembali embassy that night, and left a message saying that she was okay. Earlier, in Rock Creek Park, she had told him she would be in touch as soon as she could.<br><br>He had therefore been waiting for that contact, he told himself. But it had not come. And Caroline&#x2019;s ex, who had also been her boss, had been following her that night. Her ex had seen that Caroline knew he was following her, and had seen also that Caroline had received help in escaping from him. He also knew that Caroline&#x2019;s help had thrown a big rock right at his head.<br><br>So now this man might very well still be looking for her, and might also be looking for that help she had gotten, as another way of hunting for her.<br><br>Or so it seemed. Frank couldn&#x2019;t be sure. He sat at his desk at NSF, staring at his computer screen, trying to think it through. He could not seem to do it. Whether it was the difficulty of the problem, or the inadequacy of his mentation, he could not be sure; but he could not do it.<br>So he went to see Edgardo. He entered his colleague&#x2019;s office and said, &#x201c;Can we talk about the election result? What happened that night, and what might follow?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah! Well, that will take some time to discuss. And we were going to run today anyway. Let&#x2019;s talk about it while en route.&#x201d;<br><br>Frank took the point: no sensitive discussions to take place in their offices. Surveillance an all-too-real possibility. Frank had been on Caroline&#x2019;s list of surveilled subjects, and so had Edgardo.<br><br>In the locker room on the third floor they changed into running clothes. At the end of that process Edgardo took from his locker a security wand that resembled those used in airports; Caroline had used one like it. Frank was startled to see it there inside NSF, but nodded silently and allowed Edgardo to run it over him. Then he did the same for Edgardo.<br><br>They appeared to be clean of devices.<br><br>Then out on the streets.<br><br>As they ran, Frank said, &#x201c;Have you had that thing for long?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Too long, my friend.&#x201d; Edgar veered side to side as he ran, warming up his ankles in his usual extravagant manner. &#x201c;But I haven&#x2019;t had to get it out for a while.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you worry that having it there looks odd?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No one notices things in the locker room.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are our offices bugged?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. Yours, anyway. The thing you need to learn is that coverage is very spotty, just by the nature of the activity. The various agencies that do this have different interests and abilities, and very few even attempt total surveillance. And then only for crucial cases. Most of the rest is what you might call statistical in nature, and covers different parts of the datasphere. You can slip in and out of such surveillance.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But&#x2013;these so-called total information awareness systems, what about them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It depends. Mostly by total information they mean electronic data. And then also you might be chipped in various ways, which would give your GPS location, and perhaps record what you say. Followed, filmed&#x2013;sure, all that&#x2019;s possible, but it&#x2019;s expensive. But now we&#x2019;re clear. So tell me what&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well&#x2013;like I said. About the election results, and that program I gave you. From my friend. What happened?&#x201d;<br><br>Edgardo grinned under his mustache. &#x201c;We foxed that program. We forestalled it. You could say that we un-stole the vote in Oregon, right in the middle of the theft.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We did?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Apparently so. The program was a stochastic tilt engine that had been installed in some of Oregon and Washington&#x2019;s voting machines. My friends figured that out and managed to write a disabler, and to get it introduced at the very last minute, so there wasn&#x2019;t any time for the people who had installed the tilter to react to the change. From the sound of it, a very neat operation.&#x201d;<br><br>Frank ran along feeling a glow spread through him as he tried to comprehend it. Not only the election, de-rigged and made honest&#x2013;not only Phil Chase elected by a cleaned-up popular and electoral vote&#x2013;but his Caroline had proved true. She had risked herself and come through for the country; for the world, really. And so&#x2013;<br><br>Maybe she would come through for him too.<br><br>This train of thought led him through the glow to a new little flood of fear for her.<br><br>Edgardo saw at least some of this on his face, apparently, for he said, &#x201c;So your friend is the real thing, eh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It could get tricky for her now,&#x201d; Edgardo suggested. &#x201c;If the tweakers try to find the leakers. As we used to say at DARPA.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Frank said, his pulse rate rising at the thought.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve sent a warning?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I would if I could.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah!&#x201d; Edgardo was nodding. &#x201c;Gone away, has she?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Frank said; and then it was all pouring out of him, the whole story of how they had met and what had followed. This was something he had never managed to do with anyone, not even Rudra or Anna, and now it felt as if some kind of hydrostatic pressure had built up inside him, his silence like a dam that had now failed and let forth a flood.<br><br>It took a few miles to tell. The meeting in the stuck elevator, the unsuccessful hunt for her, the sighting of her on the Potomac during the flood, the brief phone call with her&#x2013;her subsequent call&#x2013;their meetings, their&#x2013;affair.<br><br>And then, her revealing the surveillance program she was part of, in which Frank and so many others, including Edgardo, were being tracked and evaluated in some kind of virtual futures market, wherein investors, some of them computer programs, were making speculative investments, as in any other futures markets, but this time dealing in scientists doing certain kinds of biotech research.<br><br>And then how she had had to run away on election night, and how on that night he had helped her to evade her husband and his companions, who were now clearly correlated with the attempted election theft.<br><br>Edgardo bobbed along next to him as he told the tale, nodding at each new bit of information, lips pursed tightly, head tilted to the side. It was like confessing to a giant praying mantis.<br><br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; he said at last. &#x201c;Now you&#x2019;re out of touch with her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. She said she&#x2019;d call me, but she hasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But she will have to be very careful, now that her husband knows that you exist.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. But&#x2013;will he be able to identify who I am, do you think?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think that&#x2019;s very possible, if he has access to her work files. Do you know if he does?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She worked for him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So. And he knows that someone was helping her that night.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;More than one person, actually, because of the guys in the park.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. That might help you, by muddying the waters. But still, say he goes through her records to find out who she has been in contact with&#x2013;will he find you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was one of the people she had under surveillance.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But there will be a lot of those. Anything more?&#x201d;<br><br>Frank tried to remember. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; he confessed. &#x201c;I thought we were being careful, but . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did she call you on your phone?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, a few times. But only from pay phones.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But she might have been chipped at the time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She tried to be careful about that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, but it didn&#x2019;t always work, isn&#x2019;t that what you said?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right. But&#x2013;&#x201d; Remembering back&#x2013; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think she ever said my name.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well&#x2013;if you were ever both chipped at the same time, maybe he would be able to see when you got together. And if he sourced all your cell-phone calls, some would come from pay phones, and he might be able to cross-GPS those with her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are pay phones GPSed?&#x201d;<br><br>Edgardo glanced at him. &#x201c;They stay in one spot, which you can then GPS.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh. Yeah.&#x201d;<br><br>Edgardo cackled and waved an elbow at Frank as they ran. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s lots of ways to find people! There&#x2019;s your acquaintances in the park, for instance. If he went out there and asked around, with a photo of you, he might be able to confirm.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just Professor Nosebleed to them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, but the correlations . . . So,&#x201d; Edgardo said after a silence had stretched out a quarter mile or more. &#x201c;It seems like you probably ought to take some kind of preemptive action.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well. You followed him to their apartment, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not your wisest move of that night, by the way.&#x201d;<br><br>Frank didn&#x2019;t want to explain that his capacity for decision making had been possibly injured, and perhaps not good to begin with.<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2013;but now we can probably use that information to find out his cover identity, for a start.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know the address.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you need to get it. Also the names on the doorbell plate, if there are any. But the apartment number for sure.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;ll go back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good. Be discreet. With that information, my friends could help you take it further. Given what&#x2019;s happened, they might give it a pretty high priority, to find out who he really works for.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And who do your friends work for?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well. They&#x2019;re scattered around. It&#x2019;s a kind of internal check group.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you trust them on this kind of stuff?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh yes.&#x201d; There was a reptilian look in Edgardo&#x2019;s eye that gave Frank a shiver.<br><br>In the days that followed, Frank passed his hours feeling baffled, and, under everything else, afraid. Or maybe, he thought, the feeling would be better characterized as extreme anxiety. He would wake in the mornings, take stock, remember where he was: in the Khembali embassy house&#x2019;s garden shed, with Rudra ...</p><h2>Rimbaud: Poems: Edited by Peter Washington (Everyman&#39;s Library Pocket Poets Series)</h2><p>The Everyman's Library Pocket Poets hardcover series is popular for its compact size and reasonable price which does not compromise content. <b>Poems: Rimbaud</b> contains selections from Rimbaud's work, including over 100 poems, selected prose, "Letter to Paul Demeny, May 15, 1871," and an index of first lines.</p><p>The great French poet, Arthur Rimbaud (1854-1891), who completed his revolutionary body of work by age nineteen, shattered once and for all the restraints that bound Western poetry to the realms of reason, history, and tradition.

What we don't see is how both powerful and ordinary people are remaking their lives as their country dramatically changes.<br> As the Beijing correspondent for <i>The New Yorker</i>, Evan Osnos was on the ground in China for years, witness to profound political, economic, and cultural upheaval. In <i>Age of Ambition</i>, he describes the greatest collision taking place in that country: the clash between the rise of the individual and the Communist Party's struggle to retain control. He asks probing questions: Why does a government with more success lifting people from poverty than any civilization in history choose to put strict restraints on freedom of expression? Why do millions of young Chinese professionals-fluent in English and devoted to Western pop culture-consider themselves "angry youth," dedicated to resisting the West's influence? How are Chinese from all strata finding meaning after two decades of the relentless pursuit of wealth?<br> Writing with great narrative verve and a keen sense of irony, Osnos follows the moving stories of everyday people and reveals life in the new China to be a battleground between aspiration and authoritarianism, in which only one can prevail.</p></p><p><b>Evan Osnos</b> is a staff writer at <i>The New Yorker</i>, where he served as the China correspondent from 2008 to 2013.

He moved as calmly as possible, over the pine scrub to a ledge overlooking the shore. If his plan were discovered, he would be disgraced and executed.</p> <p>Capt. Lin Zhengyi was a model soldier, one of the most celebrated young officers in the army of Taiwan, the island province ruled by opponents of the Chinese Communist Party. For three decades Taiwan had defied Communist control, and Captain Lin was a symbol of that resistance: in college, he had been a star student who&#x2019;d given up a placid civilian life to join the military, a decision so rare that Taiwan&#x2019;s future president made a point to shake his hand, and the picture was splashed all over the newspapers, turning Lin into a poster boy for the &#x201c;Holy Counterattack,&#x201d; the dream of retaking mainland China.</p> <p>Lin Zhengyi (pronounced &#x201c;Jung-yee&#x201d;) stood nearly six feet tall, with ramrod posture, a broad, flat nose, and jug ears that protruded from the rim of his hat. His devotion had earned him the assignment to the most sensitive place on the front line: the tiny island of Quemoy, known in Mandarin as Jinmen, barely one mile, across the water, from the rocky coast of mainland China.</p> <p>But Captain Lin had a secret so dangerous to him and his family that he did not dare reveal it even to his wife, who was home with their son and pregnant with their second child. Captain Lin had awoken to a sense of history gathering around him. After thirty years of turmoil, China was appealing to the people of Taiwan to reunify the &#x201c;great Motherland.&#x201d; Any soldier who tried to defect to the mainland would be shot on sight. The few who tried were exceedingly rare, though the consequences were vivid; the most recent case had occurred less than a month ago. But Lin had heard his calling. China would prosper again, he believed. And he would prosper with it.</p> <p>In the darkness he found the sandy path that could lead him safely down a hill laden with land mines. The wind off the sea had bent the gnarled island pines. The water, a brilliant crystal green by day, was now an endless black mass, surging and withdrawing with the waves. To ward off an invasion, the beaches had been fitted with long metal spears that protruded from the sand to face the sea.</p> <p>Just before the captain left the tree line for the dash to shore, he loosened the laces of his shoes and stepped barefoot onto the soil and stone. He was ready to abandon his fellow soldiers, his family, and his name.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Virtually everyone else who had tried to swim those waters had headed in the opposite direction. In 1979, mainland China was a place to flee.</p> <p>In the eighteenth century, imperial China controlled one-third of the world&#x2019;s wealth; its most advanced cities were as prosperous and commercialized as Great Britain and the Netherlands. But in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, China was crippled by invasion, civil war, and political upheaval. After taking power in 1949, the Communist Party conducted a &#x201c;land reform&#x201d; campaign that grouped China&#x2019;s small family farms into collectives, and led to the killing of millions of landlords and perceived enemies. In 1958, Chairman Mao launched the Great Leap Forward, attempting to vault his country past Britain in just fifteen years. Some advisers told him it was impossible, but he ignored and humiliated them; the head of the national technology commission jumped out a window. The propagandists hailed one fantastical harvest after another, calling them &#x201c;Sputnik harvests,&#x201d; on par with the success of the Soviet satellite. But the numbers were fiction, and as starvation spread, many who complained were tortured or killed. The Party barred people from traveling to find food. Mao&#x2019;s Great Leap Forward resulted in the world&#x2019;s worst famine, which killed between thirty and forty-five million people, more than World War I. By the time Captain Lin defected from Taiwan, the People&#x2019;s Republic was poorer than North Korea; its per capita income was one-third that of sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>Deng Xiaoping had been China&#x2019;s paramount leader for less than six months. At seventy-five, he was a persuasive but plainspoken statesman, and a survivor&#x2014;repeatedly purged from the leadership by Chairman Mao, twice rehabilitated. In the years since, he has often been described as the sole architect of the boom that followed, but that view is the handiwork of Party historians. Deng understood the limitations of his knowledge. On matters of the economy, his shrewdest move was to unite with Chen Yun, a fellow Party patriarch who was so skeptical of the West that he greeted the idea of reform by rereading Lenin&#x2019;s <i>Imperialism</i>; and with Zhao Ziyang, a younger, progressive Party boss whose efforts to reduce poverty had spawned a saying among peasants: &#x201c;If you want to eat, look for Ziyang.&#x201d;</p> <p>When change came, it came from below. The previous winter, in the inland village of Xiaogang, the local farmers had been so impoverished by Mao&#x2019;s economic vision that they had stopped tilling their communal land and had resorted to begging. In desperation, eighteen farmers divided up the land and began to farm it separately; they set their own schedules, and whatever they sold beyond the quota required by the state, they sold at the market and reaped the profits. They signed a secret pact to protect one another&#x2019;s families in the event of arrest.</p> <p>By the following year, they were earning nearly twenty times as much income as before. When the experiment was discovered, some apparatchiks accused them of &#x201c;digging up the cornerstone of socialism,&#x201d; but wiser leaders allowed their scheme to continue, and eventually expanded it to eight hundred million farmers around the country. The return of &#x201c;household&#x201d; farming, as it was known, spread so fast that a farmer compared it to a germ in a henhouse. &#x201c;When one family&#x2019;s chicken catches the disease, the whole village catches it. When one village has it, the whole county will be infected.&#x201d;</p> <p>Deng and the other leaders squabbled constantly, but the combination of Deng&#x2019;s charisma, Chen&#x2019;s hesitation to move too fast, and Zhao&#x2019;s competence was startlingly successful. The model they created endured for decades: a &#x201c;birdcage economy,&#x201d; as Chen Yun called it, airy enough to let the market thrive but not so free as to let it escape. As young revolutionaries, the elders had overseen the execution of landlords, the seizure of factories, and the creation of people&#x2019;s communes. But now they preserved their power by turning the revolution upside down: permitting private enterprise and opening a window to the outside world even if it allowed, as Deng put it, &#x201c;a few flies&#x201d; to get in. China&#x2019;s reforms had no blueprint. The strategy, as Chen Yun put it, was to move without losing control&#x2014;to &#x201c;cross the river by feeling for the stones.&#x201d; (Deng, inevitably, received credit for the expression.)</p> <p>In 1979 the Party announced that it would no longer tag people as &#x201c;landlords&#x201d; and &#x201c;rich peasants,&#x201d; and later Deng Xiaoping removed the final stigma: &#x201c;Let some people get rich first,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and gradually all the people should get rich together.&#x201d; The Party extended the economic experiment. Officially, private businesses were permitted to hire no more than eight employees&#x2014;Marx had believed that firms with more than eight workers were exploitative&#x2014;but eventually small enterprises began popping up so fast that Deng Xiaoping told a Yugoslav delegation that it was &#x201c;as if a strange army had appeared suddenly from nowhere.&#x201d; He did not take credit. &#x201c;This is not the achievement of our central government,&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>All over the country, people were exiting the collective farms that had dominated their lives. When they talked about it, they said they had been <i>songbang&#x2014;</i>&#x201c;unfettered&#x201d;&#x2014;a term more often used for a liberated prisoner or an animal. They began to talk of politics and democracy. But Deng Xiaoping had his limits. In March 1979, not long before Lin Zhengyi embarked on his adventure to the mainland, Deng spoke to a group of senior officials and demanded, &#x201c;Can we tolerate this kind of freedom of speech which flagrantly contravenes the principles of our constitution?&#x201d; The Party would never embrace &#x201c;individualist democracy.&#x201d; It would have economic freedom but political control. For China to thrive, there must be limits on &#x201c;emancipating the mind.&#x201d;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>When change began to take hold on the mainland, Lin Zhengyi watched it from afar. He was born in 1952, three years after Taiwan and the mainland had embarked on the ideological and political standoff that would endure for decades. After losing China&#x2019;s civil war to the Communists in 1949, the Nationalist Party fled to the island of Taiwan, where it declared martial law over the islands and prepared, in theory, for the day that it might return to power over China. Life in Taiwan was harsh and circumscribed. Lin grew up in the lush river delta town of Yilan, in a remote corner of Taiwan&#x2019;s main island. His family was descended from earlier migrants from the mainland. The arriving Nationalist forces viewed the earlier migrants as low-class and politically unreliable, and they were subject to widespread discrimination in jobs and education.</p> <p>His father, Lin Huoshu, ran a barbershop, and his mother took in laundry from the neighbors. The family lived in a shanty on the edge of town. But the father taught his children about ancient Chinese science and statecraft, about a civilization once so advanced that it started printing books four hundred years before Gutenberg. He read aloud from the old books&#x2014;<i>The Three Kingdoms</i>, <i>Journey to the West</i>&#x2014;and he drilled into his children the dream of China&#x2019;s revival. He named his fourth child Zhengyi because it meant &#x201c;justice.&#x201d;</p> <p>As a boy, Lin wondered why, despite China&#x2019;s glorious history, his family could barely feed itself. His older brother did not ask their mother if they would have lunch, because it was an uncomfortable question, Lin recalled. &#x201c;He would lean on the stove. If it was warm, that means we had lunch.&#x201d; Otherwise, they went hungry. For Lin, the experience fostered a highly pragmatic streak. He came to view issues of human dignity primarily through the lenses of history and economics.</p> <p>In his teens, he gravitated to tales about engineering&#x2014;the exploits of ancient Chinese leaders such as Li Bing, a governor in the third century B.C.E., in today&#x2019;s Sichuan Province, who set out to control deadly floods by devoting eight years to digging a water channel through a mountain. He relied on thousands of workers, who heated the rocks with hay fires and cooled them with water to make them crack. The result was an irrigation system so vast and durable that it is often compared to the wonders of the world; it transformed one of the country&#x2019;s poorest stretches into a region so fertile that it is known today as the &#x201c;Land of Heaven.&#x201d;</p> <p>Lin was the most promising of the sons, and in 1971 he won a coveted seat at National Taiwan University, to study irrigation. To pay his tuition, his three brothers left school and worked in their father&#x2019;s barber-shop. Lin entered college just as the campus was roiling with debate over the future of Taiwan and mainland China. For years, young people in Taiwan had been taught that the mainland was run by &#x201c;Communist bandits&#x201d; and &#x201c;demons.&#x201d; The Nationalist Party used this threat to justify martial law, and it committed widespread human rights abuses against political opponents and Communist sympathizers.</p> <p>But as Lin arrived on campus, Taiwan&#x2019;s status was eroding. In July 1971, U.S. president Richard Nixon announced his visit to Beijing. The mainland was gaining influence. In October the United Nations voted to take away Taiwan&#x2019;s seat at the UN General Assembly and give it to the People&#x2019;s Republic, acknowledging that government as the lawful representative of the Chinese people. In this climate, Lin Zhengyi found his voice. He became president of the freshman class and emerged as one of Taiwan&#x2019;s most ardent young activists. At a student rally called &#x201c;Fight the Communist Bandits Sneaking into the United Nations,&#x201d; he took the microphone and appealed for an island-wide protest, an idea so radical in the era of martial law that even his fellow activists couldn&#x2019;t bring themselves to support it. At another event, he vowed to go on a hunger strike, until the dean talked him out of it.</p> <p>When he announced that he was transferring to a military academy, he told reporters, &#x201c;If my decision to join the military can arouse nationalism in every youth&nbsp;&#x2026; then its impact will be immeasurable.&#x201d; He had practical reasons as well: at the military academy he could study for free and receive a stipend.</p> <p>At a friend&#x2019;s house one day during college, Lin met a young woman named Chen Yunying, an activist who was studying literature at National Chengchi University. After they graduated, they married and had a son. Lin spent two years studying for an MBA and then he was assigned to lead a company on the island of Quemoy, known during the Cold War as the &#x201c;lighthouse of the free world,&#x201d; because it was the final spit of land before the Communist shoreline. The two sides had once shelled each other so ferociously that Taiwan&#x2019;s military honeycombed the island with bunkers, underground restaurants, and a hospital carved so deep into the mountain that it was designed to survive a nuclear strike.</p> <p>By the time Lin arrived in 1978, the war was more psychological than physical. The armies still shelled each other, but only on schedule: the mainland fired on odd-numbered days; Taiwan returned fire the rest of the week. Mostly they dueled with propaganda. They blasted each other with enormous, high-powered speakers, and they dropped leaflets from hot-air balloons. They floated softball-sized glass containers to the opposing shores packed with bundles of goods intended to lure defectors with glimpses of prosperity. Taiwan sent pinups and miniature newspapers describing the outside world, clean underwear, pop music cassettes, instructions on how to build a simple radio, and promises of gold coins and glory for anyone willing to defect. The mainland replied with liquor, tea, sweet melons, and pamphlets with photos of smiling Taiwanese diplomats and scientists who had defected to the mainland&#x2014;or, as the Party put it, &#x201c;traded darkness for light.&#x201d;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>In December 1978, Jimmy Carter announced that the United States was officially recognizing the Communist government in Beijing, and severing formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan. The news buried any remaining hope that the island might regain control of the mainland. In Taiwan, as a correspondent put it, people were &#x201c;as nervous as a cat trying to cross a busy road with the traffic getting worse by the moment.&#x201d; On New Year&#x2019;s Day 1979, the Beijing government announced that it was ending its military bombardment of Quemoy, and broadcast an appeal to the people of Taiwan that &#x201c;the bright future&nbsp;&#x2026; belongs to us and to you.

Oral histories can be tricky things: either penetrating, delivering information and backstories that get to the heart of how timeless music was made. Or too often, they lie flat on the page, a random retelling of repeated facts and reheated yarns.

It pervades nature at every scale from the nucleus to the cosmos. Every night along the tidal rivers of Malaysia, thousands of fireflies congregate in the mangroves and flash in unison, without any leader or cue from the environment. Trillions of electrons march in lockstep in a superconductor, enabling electricity to flow through it with zero resistance. In the solar system, gravitational synchrony can eject huge boulders out of the asteroid belt and toward Earth; the cataclysmic impact of one such meteor is thought to have killed the dinosaurs. Even our bodies are symphonies of rhythm, kept alive by the relentless, coordinated firing of thousands of pacemaker cells in our hearts. In every case, these feats of synchrony occur spontaneously, almost as if nature has an eerie yearning for order. </p><p>And that raises a profound mystery: Scientists have long been baffled by the existence of spontaneous order in the universe. The laws of thermodynamics seem to dictate the opposite, that nature should inexorably degenerate toward a state of greater disorder, greater entropy. Yet all around us we see magnificent structures -- galaxies, cells, ecosystems, human beings -- that have somehow managed to assemble themselves. This enigma bedevils all of science today. Only in a few situations do we have a clear understanding of how order arises on its own. The first case to yield was a particular kind of order <i>in physical space</i> involving perfectly repetitive architectures. It's the kind of order that occurs whenever the temperature drops below the freezing point and trillions of water molecules spontaneously lock themselves into a rigid, symmetrical crystal of ice. Explaining order <i>in time</i>, however, has proved to be more problematic. Even the simplest possibility, where the same things happen at the same times, has turned out to be remarkably subtle. This is the order we call synchrony. </p><p>It may seem at first that there's little to explain. You can agree to meet a friend at a restaurant, and if both of you are punctual, your arrivals will be synchronized. An equally mundane kind of synchrony is triggered by a reaction to a common stimulus. Pigeons startled by a car backfiring will all take off at the same time, and their wings may even flap in sync for a while, but only because they reacted the same way to the same noise. They're not actually communicating about their flapping rhythm and don't maintain their synchrony after the first few seconds. Other kinds of transient sync can arise by chance. On a Sunday morning, the bells of two different churches may happen to ring at the same time for a while, and then drift apart. Or while sitting in your car, waiting to turn at a red light, you might notice that your blinker is flashing in perfect time with that of the car ahead of you, at least for a few beats. Such sync is pure coincidence, and hardly worth noting. </p><p>The impressive kind of sync is persistent. When two things keep happening simultaneously for an extended period of time, the synchrony is probably not an accident. Such persistent sync comes easily to us human beings, and, for some reason, it often gives us pleasure. We like to dance together, sing in a choir, play in a band. In its most refined form, persistent sync can be spectacular, as in the kickline of the Rockettes or the matched movements of synchronized swimmers. The feeling of artistry is heightened when the audience has no idea where the music is going next, or what the next dance move will be. We interpret persistent sync as a sign of intelligence, planning, and choreography. </p><p>So when sync occurs among unconscious entities like electrons or cells, it seems almost miraculous. It's surprising enough to see animals cooperating -- thousands of crickets chirping in unison on a summer night; the graceful undulating of schools of fish -- but it's even more shocking to see mobs of mindless things falling into step by themselves. These phenomena are so incredible that some commentators have been led to deny their existence, attributing them to illusions, accidents, or perceptual errors. Other observers have soared into mysticism, attributing sync to supernatural forces in the cosmos. </p><p>Until just a few years ago, the study of synchrony was a splintered affair, with biologists, physicists, mathematicians, astronomers, engineers, and sociologists laboring in their separate fields, pursuing seemingly independent lines of inquiry. Yet little by little, a science of sync has begun coalescing out of insights from these and other disciplines. This new science centers on the study of "coupled oscillators." Groups of fireflies, planets, or pacemaker cells are all collections of oscillators -- entities that cycle automatically, that repeat themselves over and over again at more or less regular time intervals. Fireflies flash; planets orbit; pacemaker cells fire. Two or more oscillators are said to be coupled if some physical or chemical process allows them to influence one another. Fireflies communicate with light. Planets tug on one another with gravity. Heart cells pass electrical currents back and forth. As these examples suggest, nature uses every available channel to allow its oscillators to talk to one another. And the result of those conversations is often synchrony, in which all the oscillators begin to move as one. </p><p>Those of us working in this emerging field are asking such questions as: How exactly do coupled oscillators synchronize themselves, and under what conditions? When is sync impossible and when is it inevitable? What other modes of organization are to be expected when sync breaks down? And what are the practical implications of all that we're trying to learn? </p><p>Copyright � 2003 Steven Strogatz</p></p><h2>The Oxford Inklings: Lewis, Tolkien and their circle</h2><p>The Oxford Inklings tells the story of the friendships, mutual influence, and common purpose of the Inklings - the literary circle which congregated around C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. Meeting in pubs or Lewis&#39;s college rooms, they included an influential array of literary figures. They were, claimed poet and novelist John Wain, bent on &#39;the task of redirecting the whole current of contemporary art and life&#39;. Tolkien and Lewis expert Colin Duriez unpacks the Inklings&#39; origins, relationships, and the nature of their collaboration. He shows how they influenced, encouraged, and moulded each other. Duriez also covers the less celebrated Inklings, neglected, he claims, for too long. What did they owe - and offer - to the more acknowledged names? What brought them together? And what, eventually, drove them apart from their initial focus upon each other&#39;s writings?</p><p>Colin Duriez is an expert on C.S. Lewis, his writings and also his wider circle. He is also the author of the popular biography C.S. Lewis: A biography of friendship and J.R.R. Tolkien: The Making of a Legend (both published by Lion Hudson). He has also written widely on other aspects of Lewis, Tolkien and the other members of the Inklings, and has contributed to conferences, lectures, DVDs and documentaries on these subjects.&#34;Excellent! This is one of the best books on the Inklings I&#39;ve ever read.&#34; -- Walter Hooper, Literary Advisor to the C.S. Lewis Estate &#34;Few people know the Inklings as intimately as Duriez who makes us feel as though he has just come from a morning with them at the Eagle and Child.&#34; -- Harry Lee Poe, author of The Inklings of Oxford and C.S. Lewis Remembered &#34;Just when I thought nothing new could be said about Lewis, Tolkien, Barfield, Williams, and the others, gifted author Colin Duriez presents fresh and fascinating insights.&#34; -- Carolyn Curtis, author</p><h2>Gnomon: A novel</h2><p><b>A Best Science Fiction Book of 2017 --<i> The Guardian</i><br><br>From the widely acclaimed author of <i>The Gone-Away World </i>and <i>Tigerman</i>, comes a virtuosic new novel set in a near-future, high-tech surveillance state, that is equal parts dark comedy, gripping detective story, and mind-bending philosophical puzzle.</b><br><br>In the world of <i>Gnomon</i>, citizens are constantly observed and democracy has reached a pinnacle of 'transparency.' Every action is seen, every word is recorded, and the System has access to its citizens' thoughts and memories--all in the name of providing the safest society in history.<br><br> When suspected dissident Diana Hunter dies in government custody, it marks the first time a citizen has been killed during an interrogation. The System doesn't make mistakes, but something isn't right about the circumstances surrounding Hunter's death. Mielikki Neith, a trusted state inspector and a true believer in the System, is assigned to find out what went wrong. Immersing herself in neural recordings of the interrogation, what she finds isn't Hunter but rather a panorama of characters within Hunter's psyche: a lovelorn financier in Athens who has a mystical experience with a shark; a brilliant alchemist in ancient Carthage confronting the unexpected outcome of her invention; an expat Ethiopian painter in London designing a controversial new video game, and a sociopathic disembodied intelligence from the distant future. <br><br> Embedded in the memories of these impossible lives lies a code which Neith must decipher to find out what Hunter is hiding. In the static between these stories, Neith begins to catch glimpses of the real Diana Hunter--and, alarmingly, of herself. The staggering consequences of what she finds will reverberate throughout the world.<br><br> A dazzling, panoramic achievement, and Nick Harkaway's most brilliant work to date, <i>Gnomon</i> is peerless and profound, captivating and irreverent, as it pierces through strata of reality and consciousness, and illuminates how to set a mind free. It is a truly accomplished novel from a mind possessing a matchless wit infused with a deep humanity.</p><p>NICK HARKAWAY is the author of three previous novels, <i>The Gone-Away World</i>, <i>Angelmaker</i>, and <i>Tigerman</i>, as well as a nonfiction work about digital culture, <i>The Blind Giant: Being Human in a Digital World</i>. He is also a regular blogger for <i>The Bookseller's FutureBook </i>website. He lives in London with his wife, a human rights lawyer, and their two children.<b>My Mind On the Screen</b><br><br>The death of a suspect in custody,&#x201d; says Inspector Neith of the Witness, &#x201c;is a very serious matter. There is no one at the Witness Programme who does not feel a sense of personal failure this morning.&#x201d;<br><br>She is looking straight into the camera and her sincerity is palpable. A dozen different mood assessment softwares examine the muscles around her mouth and eyes. Her microexpressions verify her words. As a matter of course, the more sophisticated algorithms check for the telltale marks of Botox and of bioelectric stimulators that might allow her to fake that painful honesty, but no one really expects to find anything, and no one does.<br><br>Polling data streams across the screen: 89 per cent believe the Witness was not at fault. Of the remainder of the population, the overwhelming majority believes that any culpability will turn out to be negligent rather than designed. Neith&#x2019;s own figures are even better: she has been called in to investigate the matter precisely because her personal probity is the highest ever measured. All but the most corrosively paranoid of the focus groups accept her good faith.<br><br>It is a very good showing, even granting that the Witness has consistently high approval anyway. All the same, the discussion of Diana Hunter continues in the Public Sphere&#x2014;as it should&#x2014;until it is eclipsed by the next of the killings.<br><br>***<br><br>Ninety minutes before, Mielikki Neith stares into her morning mirror, feeling the vertiginous uncertainty that sometimes comes with viewing one&#x2019;s own image, the inability to understand the meaning of her reflected face. She repeats her name, quite softly but with growing emphasis, hearing the noise and yet unable to connect it with the self she feels. Not that she is anyone else: not that any other collection of syllables or features would be better. It is the intermediation of physicality and naming, of being represented in biology or language,that doesn&#x2019;t sit with her in this disconnected instant. She knows it is simply a lingering trace of the dream state, but that does not alter herconviction&#x2014;inappropriatelycellular, felt in blood and bone&#x2014;that something is wrong.<br><br>She is correct. In a few moments she will start work, and the day will set her inevitably on the path to the involuted Alkahest. She is just hours from her first meeting with weird, cartilaginous L�nnrot, just over a week from her loss of faith in everything she has believed in her life. As she steps out of her slippers and begins to wash, finding in the animal business of grooming the growing understanding of her body and its place in the process that is her, she is stepping not only on to the cracked white shower tray but also on to that road, the one that conducts her without let or hindrance to a point of crisis: to endings andapocatastasis. She apprehends this now with knowledge she has, from her limited vantage point inside the flow of events, not yet gleaned&#x2014;but that knowledge is so significant that its echo reaches her even here, gathered in the slipstream of the Chamber of Isis and the most complex and saintly murder in the history of crime. Neith&#x2019;s consciousness is etiolated this morning because it touches itself irregularly along its own extension in time, a contact that makes her almost&#x2014;but, crucially, not quite&#x2014;prescient. Instead of foresight, the Inspector gets a migraine, and in that small difference she sets her feet on the pattern that must eventually lead her to all the things I have already mentioned, but most fatefully&#x2014;fatally&#x2014;to me.<br><br>***<br><br><i>I can see my mind on the screen</i><br><br>The Inspector awoke this morning, as she does almost every day, to the sound of technological obsolescence. Her residence, provided by the System to employees of her grade, is an airy one-bedroom flat in a period building in Piccadilly Circus. The ancient neon light directly outside her window is faulty and makes a noise when it switches on: the death rattle of twentieth-century advertising. She has complained about it, but does not anticipate any change in her circumstance. Machines these days are somewhat perfected; a visible glitch in a high profile space such as this has been found to project a reassuring fallibility and evoke a sense of well being which endures for several days. It conveys the continuing humanness of a nation under digitally mediated governance. The figures are unambiguous.<br><br>She listens now, in the quiet aftermath of her public statements, to the hum of the light at full function. When she goes close to the window, she is sure she can feel the hairs on her arms plucked by a static charge, but knows this for a psychosomatic illusion. She turns back to her desk, palms to forehead, then cheeks, and down the line of the nose. Broadcast lights make her eyes itch in their sockets.<br><br>Here, then, is her new case, MNEITH-GNOMON-10559. The name looks like nonsense until you know the framework into which it fits. Framing is everything, in filing as in investigative work. First of all, the label acknowledges that it is her case by logging it under her name. The actual ID number is the last part, &#x201c;10559,&#x201d; but human beings give things names rather than numbers and this way the Witness can control what that name is, avoiding the inadvertent compromise of operations. The specific term, in this case &#x201c;GNOMON,&#x201d; is randomly assigned from a list. &#x201c;THE HUNTER CASE&#x201d; would be less cumbersome, but there might be another case involving another Hunter, and it would not be appropriate to conflate them. &#x201c;GNOMON&#x201d; is there to avoid any kind of confusion: an incontrovertible statement of identity. Beyond that, it apparently means an early geometer&#x2019;s tool for marking right angles, a set square made of metal. By extension it means something perpendicular to everything else, such as the upright part of a sundial. She finds the name itchily � propos, a handful of sand in her cognitive shoe. The Hunter case does stick out. She said that in the interview earlier, but only the channel known as TLDR is actually hosting the whole segment and so far no one has accessed the file. TLDR is basically an archive, paid for by donations from high net worth individuals who believe in archiving.<br><br>She reviews the case preamble: Hunter, awake and obdurate, a cranky old lady with round cheeks and a bad attitude that must have been fashionable when she was in her twenties.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you wish at this time to undergo a verbal interview which may obviate the need for a direct investigation?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do not.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you wish at this time to make a statement?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll state that I do not submit to this voluntarily. I consider it a baseless intrusion, and very rude.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We are committed to affording you the maximum of dignity and care during your time with us. All staff will treat you with the utmost courtesy within the boundaries of their assigned tasks.&#x201d;<br><br>She sighs. &#x201c;Then please record that I am a woman in the prime of life, whose powers are severely limited by authorities perishing with thirst, and now demanding that I make a gift to them of the waters of memory.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Noted,&#x201d; the technician says, bland in the face of unexpected poetry.The Inspector can hear something in his voice, a mild frustration with this uppity biddy whose interrogation will surely yield nothing more than the misanthropy of the hermetic old.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, indeed,&#x201d; Hunter agrees. &#x201c;Everything is.&#x201d;<br><br>The medical staff come in then, and Hunter goes limp and makes them lift her on to the gurney: old-fashioned passive resistance, pointlessly antagonistic. Once, she screams, and they almost drop her. That makes the restraint team visibly unhappy, and she laughs at them. Her teeth are very white against her skin.<br><br>Finally they get her into the chair and the needle goes into the back of her hand. Hunter scowls, then settles back as if getting comfortable for a very boring and time-consuming argument she has determined she must have.<br><br>The Inspector touches the terminals, jolts as the dead woman&#x2019;s mind settles over her own: Diana Hunter, deceased. What is the flavour of her life? Sixty-one years of age, divorced, no children. Educated at Madrigal Academy and then Bristol University. By profession an administrator, and then later a writer of obscurantist magical realist novels, she was apparently once celebrated, then reclusive, then forgotten. Most successful book: The Mad Cartographer&#x2019;s Garden, in which the reader is invited to untangle not only the puzzle that confronts the protagonists but also a separate one allegedly hidden in the text like a sort of enormous crossword clue; most famous arguably the last, titled <i>Quaerendo Invenietis</i>, which received only a very limited publication and became an urban legend of sorts, with the usual associated curiosities. <i>Quaerendo </i>contains secret truths that are downright dangerous to the mind, or an actual working spell, or the soul of an angel, or Hunter&#x2019;s own, and the act of reading it in the right place at the right time will bring about the end of the world, or possibly the beginning, or will unleash ancient gods from their prison. First year university students in the humanities pore over the accessible fragments and consider they are touching some fatal cosmic revelation. Copies of the book, of which only one hundred were printed, are now almost impossibly expensive, and Hunter somehow contrived to extract from each purchaser a commitment not to scan any part of what they had, with the result that even now there is no online edition, and indeed no verifiable text at all.<br><br>It all added up to a remarkable frenzy of excitement and localised notoriety, then went quiet when the book, read by various people in various times and places, failed to end the onward march of time or drive anyone mad. In other words, the Inspector is inclined to believe, Hunter was a purveyor of educated and ultimately meaningless literary flim flam who got bored of the joke and retired. Since then, her only contribution to the body of English literature has been a series of rambling and condemnatory letters to the local paper. If she was, in fact, a dangerous terrorist, her cover was as fully realised and performed as any in the long and unglamorous history of subversion. More likely she was the lonely algorithmic victim of a perfect storm&#x2014;and yet despite its improbability, the notion that she may somehow have been more than she appeared is ineradicable.<br><br>Neith begins again.<br><br><i>I can see my mind on the screen</i><br><br>Hunter&#x2019;s first thought during the examination is like the barb on a fishhook, and Neith instinctively loathes it. These eight unremarkable words cause her to tighten her jaw as if expecting a blow. The phrase is, to be sure, unusually clear and strong, quite ready to be vocalised. One must assume that Hunter was deliberately recording a message, in which case: to whom? To Neith, as the investigating officer? Or to an imagined historian? Why does the tone, the clean, discursive flavour of Hunter&#x2019;s mind, trouble that part of the Inspector that is devoted to a professional mistrust of appearances?</p><h2>Essential Sacred Writings From Around the World</h2><p><p>Originally published as&nbsp;<em>From Primitives to Zen</em>, this comprehensive anthology contains writings vital to all the major non-Western religious traditions, arranged thematically.

Known for his ability to read and interpret ancient Sumerian and Akkadian clay tablets, Zecharia Sitchin (1920-2010) took the words of our most ancient ancestors as fact and, through decades of meticulous research, showed that they revealed a coherent narrative about the true origins of humanity and civilization. Drawing both widespread interest and criticism, his Earth Chronicles series of books, beginning with <i>The 12th Planet</i>, detailed how humanity arose after the arrival of the Anunnaki (&#x201c;those who from Heaven to Earth came&#x201d;), alien &#x201c;gods&#x201d; who created modern man in their own image and imparted gifts of civilizing knowledge. <br> <br>Providing an insider&#x2019;s look into the decades of research behind Zecharia Sitchin&#x2019;s complete works as well as an in-depth overview of his theories, this collection includes carefully selected chapters from the Earth Chronicles series as well as never-before-published letters, articles, and lectures. We learn about the genesis of <i>The 12th Planet</i> in &#x201c;The Book as a Story,&#x201d; the Sumerians and their Anunnaki influences in &#x201c;The Sudden Civilization,&#x201d; the orbit of Nibiru in &#x201c;UFOs, Pyramids, and the 12th Planet,&#x201d; the prehistory of the Americas in &#x201c;Cities Lost and Found,&#x201d; the extraterrestrial origins of modern man in &#x201c;The Cosmic Connection--DNA,&#x201d; and much more. We get to read never-before-published lectures, culled from Sitchin&#x2019;s decades of presentations, as well as the article that spurred the writing of <i>There Were Giants Upon the Earth</i>. <br> <br>Each piece includes an introduction by Sitchin&#x2019;s niece, offering context and insight into Sitchin&#x2019;s passionate work. These introductions reveal the man behind the theories, a world traveler known for his scholarship, dry humor, and precisely chosen words. If his theories are true, as Sitchin wholeheartedly believed, then this collection presents some of the most important knowledge we have of our origins and future.</p><p>Zecharia Sitchin (1920-2010), an eminent biblical scholar and internationally acclaimed author, grew up in Palestine, where he acquired a profound knowledge of modern and ancient Hebrew, other Semitic and European languages, the Old Testament, and the history and archaeology of the Near East.

National ad/promo. Tour.</p><p>At the time of his death in 2003, James Welch was considered one of the most important authors of the American West. His books include Fool&#x2019;s Crow and Winter in the Blood.In his first nonfiction work, noted Native American novelist Welch (The Indian Lawyer, 1990, etc.) stretches the boundaries of history. With the research assistance of Stekler, Welch offers a sweeping history of the American West based on work the pair did for their 1992 PBS documentary, The Last Stand. Though centered on the Battle of the Little Big Horn, in which warriors led by Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull defeated Custer's 7th Cavalry, the volume actually chronicles white/Indian contact and conflict from the voyage of Lewis and Clark in 1804 to the present--from the viewpoint of the Indians. Welch begins by describing the 1869 massacre of a band of his own Blackfeet people and his efforts to locate the forgotten site of the carnage. He then moves on to the story of Custer, a Civil War hero who was demoted following the war and sent to fight Indians on the Western frontier. His conduct at the Washita Massacre, during which he and his men wiped out Black Kettle's peaceful Cheyenne, called his abilities into question and demonstrated the character and leadership flaws that would help bring about his death eight years later. Brash, cavalier, and supremely confident, Custer embodied America's larger self-image. His death, in the worst military disaster of the Indian Wars, thus assumed mythic proportions, aided by a relentless publicity campaign by his widow. Welch traces the fates of Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull following the famous battle and uses accounts of such other engagements as Sand Creek and the Fetterman Massacre to help put Little Big Horn in historical perspective. A late chapter personalizes the text, as Welch tells the story of his mother and his early desire to become a writer. An excellent Native version of Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: a sad tale that, despite momentary triumphs like Little Big Horn, could not but end tragically for the Indians.

Much of the book takes the form of a discussion between a teacher and his students. They propose various solutions to some mathematical problems and investigate the strengths and weaknesses of these solutions. Their discussion (which mirrors certain real developments in the history of mathematics) raises some philosophical problems and some problems about the nature of mathematical discovery or creativity. Imre Lakatos is concerned throughout to combat the classical picture of mathematical development as a steady accumulation of established truths. He shows that mathematics grows instead through a richer, more dramatic process of the successive improvement of creative hypotheses by attempts to &#39;prove&#39; them and by criticism of these attempts: the logic of proofs and refutations.</p><p>A novel introduction to the philosophy of mathematics, mostly in the form of a discussion between a group of students and their teacher.

She is the author of Painting Watercolor Portraits that Glow, Painting Beautiful Watercolors From Photographs and Watercolor Basics: Color. She lives in Newport, Oregon.<p>YA-Kunz's book is for artists who enjoy the medium and want to delve into portraying flowers. It provides beautiful color reproductions and helpful advice, as well as lots of encouragement. The author opens with a practical introduction that includes the tools and materials needed to develop watercolor technique. She helps readers learn to analyze a flower so that it can be seen both as a whole as well as a component part of a picture. A discussion of painting flowers from photographs is included. Most useful is the chapter about capturing the illusion of sunshine. Ranson's book is better suited to general readers, as it is an introduction to the entire field of watercolor. One of the strongest sections details types of brushes and how to use each one to achieve the desired effects. Following the usual sections on techniques and painting various subjects, Ranson includes several practice ``assignments.'' Kunz's controlled method of working will appeal to some, while Ranson's looser, ``free style'' approach will appeal to others.-Sandi Hammonds, W.T.

This second edition of her definitive illustrated guide adds 40 percent new material, with more coverage of different kinds of trees, shrubs, and ground covers and how to prune them for health and aesthetics. The book is organized around the most common types of plants found in Northwest gardens: evergreen and deciduous shrubs; bamboos and tea roses; rhododendrons, camellia and other tree-like shrubs; hedge plants like boxwood and heather; clematis, wisteria and all those vines; and detailed information on trees by species from dogwoods to weeping cherries. In her trademark witty style, Turnbull also addresses tools, landscape renovation, and design errors. Included too are her amusing Ten Commandments for gardeners, which feature such treasures as &#34;Thou shalt not weed-whip the trunk of thy tree, nor bash it with thine mower, nor leave anything tied on thy tree or the branches of thy tree, as is done in the land of the philistines.&#34;</p><p>Cass Turnbull is the humorous voice of PlantAmnesty, giving indispensable pruning advice through the organization&#39;s newsletter. Both she and Kate Allen live in Seattle."There are many pruning guidebooks available, but only one (this one!) by the founder of PlantAmnesty. . . . goes far beyond the basic commandments. . . . we found the drawings particularly helplful." &#x2014;HortIdeas "Get a copy of Cass Turnbull&#x2019;s Guide t</p><h2>My Antonia (Vintage Classics)</h2><p>In this symphonically powerful&nbsp;novel, Willa Cather created one of the most winning&nbsp;heroines in American fiction, a woman whose robust high spirits and calm, undemonstrative strength are emblematic of the virtues Cather most admired in her country.<br><br>Antonia Shimerda is the&nbsp;daughter of Bohemian immigrants struggling with the oceanic loneliness of life on the Nebraska prairie. Through the eyes of Jim Burden, her tutor and disappointed admirer, we follow Antonia from farm to town and through hardships both natural and human, surviving everything from poverty to a failed romance--and not only surviving, but triumphing.&nbsp;In the end, Antonia is exactly what Burden says she is: a woman who "had that something which fires the imagination, [a woman who] could stop . . . one's breath for a moment by a look or a gesture that somehow revealed the meaning in common things."</p><p>It seems almost sacrilege to infringe upon a book as soulful and rich as Willa Cather's <i>My �ntonia</i> by offering comment. First published in 1918, and set in Nebraska in the late 19th century, this tale of the spirited daughter of a Bohemian immigrant family planning to farm on the untamed land ("not a country at all but the material out of which countries are made") comes to us through the romantic eyes of Jim Burden. He is, at the time of their meeting, newly orphaned and arriving at his grandparents' neighboring farm on the same night her family strikes out to make good in their new country. Jim chooses the opening words of his recollections deliberately: "I first heard of �ntonia on what seemed to be an interminable journey across the great midland plain of North America," and it seems almost certain that readers of Cather's masterpiece will just as easily pinpoint the first time they heard of �ntonia and her world. It seems equally certain that they, too, will remember that moment as one of great light in an otherwise unremarkable trip through the world.<p> �ntonia, who, even as a grown woman somewhat downtrodden by circumstance and hard work, "had not lost the fire of life," lies at the center of almost every human condition that Cather's novel effortlessly untangles. She represents immigrant struggles with a foreign land and tongue, the restraints on women of the time (with which Cather was very much concerned), the more general desires for love, family, and companionship, and the great capacity for forbearance that marked the earliest settlers on the frontier.</p><p> As if all this humanity weren't enough, Cather paints her descriptions of the vastness of nature--the high, red grass, the road that "ran about like a wild thing," the endless wind on the plains--with strokes so vivid as to make us feel in our bones that we've just come in from a walk on that very terrain ourselves. As the story progresses, Jim goes off to the University in Lincoln to study Latin (later moving on to Harvard and eventually staying put on the East Coast in another neat encompassing of a stage in America's development) and learns Virgil's phrase "<i>Optima dies ... prima fugit</i>" that Cather uses as the novel's epigraph. "The best days are the first to flee"--this could be said equally of childhood and the earliest hours of this country in which the open land, much like <i>My �ntonia</i>, was nothing short of a rhapsody in prairie sky blue. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art.

Ayer in a fabled debate about the existence of God and the possibility of metaphysics, knew that seminary students were fed a woefully inadequate diet of theses and proofs, and that their familiarity with most of history's great thinkers&nbsp;&nbsp;was reduced to simplistic caricatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;Copleston set out to redress the wrong by writing a complete history of Western Philosophy, one crackling with incident an intellectual excitement - and one that gives full place to each thinker, presenting his thought in a beautifully rounded manner and showing his links to those who went before and to those who came after him.</p><p>Frederick Copleston grew up in England. He was raised in an Anglican home but converted to Catholicism while a student at Marlborough College. He later became a Jesuit and then pursued a career in academia. He studied and lectured at Heythrop College and wrote an eleven-volume <i>History of Philosophy</i>, which is highly respected. He also spent time teaching at Gregorian University in Rome and, after he retired, lectured at Santa Clara University in California. He was appointed a member of the British Academy in 1970. He is famouse for debating Betrand Russell over the existence of God in a 1948 BBC broadcast.</p><h2>The Student&#39;s Friend Concise World History: Parts 1 and 2</h2><p><p><b>UNLIKE TRADITIONAL TEXTBOOKS</b> that can overwhelm the reader with countless facts to absorb, the <i>Student's Friend Concise World History</i> highlights the most important developments of world history in a clear and concise manner that is capable of being comprehended by the human mind.</p><p> In comparison to standard thousand-page textbooks, the <i>Student's Friend</i> addresses world history in 127 pages, and at $9.95 per book, each student can receive her or his own copy to mark up and keep for future reference. (It would take approximately 9 to 14 years of giving students these books to equal the cost of one classroom set of traditional textbooks.)</p><p>Teachers have successfully used <i>The Student's Friend</i> in homeschool, middle school, high school, and college in the United States and abroad. In contrast to other concise histories that may focus on impersonal historical processes, <i>The Student's Friend</i> features men and women who helped to shape history and who illustrate timeless aspects of human nature.</p><p><b>WHY A CONCISE HISTORICAL NARRATIVE?</b> <i>The Student's Friend</i> is designed to be consistent with findings from cognitive science that emphasize learning the most important principles and concepts of a school discipline, rather than learning large quantities of superficial facts that are likely to be forgotten shortly after the exam is over. The respected Bradley Commission on History in Schools has said, "The amount of time required to achieve student engagement and genuine comprehension of significant issues will necessitate leaving out much that is 'covered' by the usual text."</p><p><b> CONCISENESS CAN BRING CLARITY.</b> Cognitive psychologist Frank N. Dempster has written, "Many texts are so packed with facts, names, and details that the real point of the lesson is often obscured." One of the greatest benefits of a concise historical narrative is the clarity it can bring to a student's understanding of history by focusing on essential knowledge rather than on extensive, sometimes confusing, and often-trivial detail.</p><p><b>ELIMINATES GAPS AND DISCONTINUITIES.</b> Teachers can't adequately cover all the information contained in standard thousand-page textbooks, so they commonly skip around in the textbook, which can leave big holes in the historical narrative. <i>The Student's Friend</i> is designed to include no more information than students can realistically cover during a standard high school course. Because the picking and choosing has been carefully done and logically sequenced, continuity is maintained and gaps eliminated.</p><p><b>BALANCES BREADTH AND DEPTH.</b> The concise historical narrative leaves time in the curriculum for additional learning activities such as research papers, multimedia presentations, source-analysis activities, and simulations, a practice sometimes called "postholing." The narrative performs a unifying function like a fence that gives shape to the landscape and provides the connecting fabric between events, while postholes are occasions to dig more deeply into the human dimensions of history--to explore how events of the past affected people's lives then and now.</p><p>The subject matter of world history is so vast that it can be a difficult subject to grasp and to teach. Teachers and students alike can benefit from the understandable picture of history offered by <i>The Student's Friend Concise World History.</i></p><p><b>Note: As this is a concise world history, those accustomed to the extensive detail of standard textbooks may wish to click on the <i>Look Inside</i> feature to see if this book will meet their needs and expectations.</b></p></p><p>My two books about history education complement each other.&nbsp;<i>Future-Focused History Teaching&nbsp;</i>reports findings from cognitive science that call for teachers to emphasize the most important knowledge in a school discipline so as to produce learning useful in the future.&nbsp;<i>The Student's Friend Concise World History&nbsp;</i>implements this suggestion by&nbsp;focusing on the most important concepts and developments of world history and by limiting superficial detail that can interfere with effective understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the&nbsp;<i>Student's Friend</i>&nbsp;provides a big picture of human development through time, which is one of four kinds of historical knowledge identified as suitable for history education in&nbsp;<i>Future-Focused History Teaching</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Website: studentsfriend.com &nbsp;Blog: futurefocusedhistory.blog<i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Student's Friend Concise World History</i> has been available online as a free download since 2001, and the latest version is now available in book form with features not included in the download version.

When writing this text, they considered <i><b>career relevance</b></i> as their guide when selecting material, and the need to <i><b>engage the student</b></i> as their guide to style, pedagogy, and design.<br><b>Libby/Libby/Hodge</b> successfully implements a real-world, single <b>focus company approach in every chapter.</b> Students and instructors have responded very favorably to the use of focus companies and the real-world financial statements. The companies chosen are engaging and the decision-making focus shows the relevance of financial accounting regardless of whether or not the student has chosen to major in accounting.<br><b>Libby/Libby/Hodge</b> believes in the <b>building-block approach to teaching transaction analysis</b>. Most faculty agree that mastery of the accounting cycle is critical to success in financial accounting. And yet all other financial books introduce and develop transaction analysis in one chapter, bombarding a student early in the course with an overload of new concepts and terms. The authors believe that most faculty take more time with the accounting cycle, but other financial accounting textbooks don't. By slowing down the introduction of transactions and giving students time to practice and gain mastery, this building-block approach leads to greater student success in their study of later topics in financial accounting such as adjusting entries.<br></p><p>Patricia Libby is chair of the department of accounting and an associate professor of accounting at Ithaca College, where she teaches the undergraduate financial accounting course.

A revolution was brewing and I was at the center of it, though I didn't know it. Just around the corner from my university was Xerox PARC, where Steve Jobs was being entranced by the mouse and imagining a personal computer. Thirty-five miles to the north was Haight-Ashbury, with its hippies and their counterculture, a revolution of color, scent, sex, and style. Fifty miles to the northeast was Berkeley, where students were occupying parks and making radical demands, and forty miles to the south was Santa Cruz, where the organic food movement was sprouting.<br><br> And I was in college, living in a rather strange house that would affect my point of view for the rest of my life.<br><br> I'd been in a dormitory until the university, in a first tick of that clock of revolution, rescinded its rule that women live on campus, check into their dormitories before midnight, and see male guests only downstairs. So I began to look around for a different kind of place, and I found it on a bulletin board in the Student Union:<br><br> "American family recently returned from Switzerland seeks university student for extra bedroom."<br><br> I telephoned and then went over to take a look at the room and meet the family.<br><br> The house was just five miles from the university, in the hills where the rich lived in a kind of rural simulacrum, down-to-earth and expensive. I drove down the private lane; in the field on my right, three horses were grazing; in the driveway, chickens were scratching. Jane, the wife, answered the door, and then she showed me around.<br><br> The house had been built by a student of Frank Lloyd Wright's, she told me, and it was sprawling, made of adobe and wood, with exposed beams, a heated red concrete floor, and an enormous fireplace with built-in seats. The architect had spared an old oak and built the house around it, so there was a tree growing up through the middle of the living room and out the roof to the sky. Then she took me into the garden, where zucchini and tomatoes were growing in the midst of roses, and then around to the back and I saw the extra bedroom. It had a Swedish slat bed, a sit-down shower, and a teak deck, and looked out onto the Coast Range. It was exotic and peaceful, and I took it.<br><br> In that house I would get to be a sort of hippie.<br><br> "Sort of" because it was a nice house near the fine university I attended, I was supported by my parents, and I didn't take drugs. "Hippie" because we experimented. The Neumanns had just returned from Switzerland after a twelve-year stay, and their three daughters, though in theory American, spoke English with a Swiss-German accent. They brought back with them the Swiss living they'd learned: washing on Monday, ironing on Tuesday, waxing the floors on Wednesday. Also the six-month supply of food mandated in Switzerland, which were forty-pound tins in the garage, of wheat, rye, and beans.<br><br> They also brought back with them a certain worldview. It was what the French call the longue dur e, and very different from my American worldview. From its perspective, the Romans had only been passing through, and the Middle Ages were not so long ago. The Renaissance, Reformation, and Enlightenment were recent, and America was a charming, puzzling blip on the screen. It was a worldview that tried out each new period, preserved what worked, discarded what didn't, and added what worked to its older ways of being in the world. Many of those ways were remarkably similar to the new ways Americans were discovering, I would learn. Organic food. Meditative spirituality. Political rebelliousness. The congruence of right living, satisfying living, and happy living.<br><br> Jane was Mom. She was from an old California family and American through and through. She'd intended to become a biologist, but she married Walter instead and became a wife. In Switzerland she became a perfect wife, obeying the recycling the Swiss did even back then not because of laws but because of their frugal aesthetics. It was wasteful to discard anything usable, she explained to me one day. So every Swiss home had six bins-a white-glass bin, a green-glass bin, a neither-white-nor-green-glass bin, a paper bin, a compost bin, and a trash bin, and the neighbors knew just how much trash was in the trash bin. They also knew whether you washed on Monday, ironed on Tuesday, and waxed on Wednesday.<br><br> In Switzerland they'd lived in the village of Kusnacht on Lake Zurich. Carl Jung lived up the street, and Marie-Louise von Franz, Jung's most famous disciple, had herself analyzed Jane. Jane was brilliant but diaphanous; unchallenging, vague, distant. She was like the bird that wandered into the house one day and threw itself against every window trying to get out.<br><br> What she brought to the house was a certain Way-perhaps Swiss, perhaps Jung, perhaps her grandparents', perhaps her very own. It was the way we would eventually call Slow and included Indian gurus and the first organic food I ever ate. I would get back from the university and find the newest guru sitting at the table by the oak tree, surrounded by disciples and the smell of curry, incense, floor wax, and laundry. Jane was the Queen, the Moon, a Jungian extroverted feeling type.<br><br> Naturally Walter, her husband, was an introverted thinking type. He was tall and thin, and his hair was turning white. His thick mustache was white already. He rode a bicycle to his work as the director of bioengineering at one of the first high-tech companies in Silicon Valley, which focused on electromagnetic equipment. One evening he came home and explained to us how the new technology he was working on would revolutionize agriculture. A Green Revolution would feed the world, he said, because the NMR (MRI) machine they'd invented could analyze the protein content of seeds without damaging them. Jane, the guru, and the disciples listened politely, and then went back to discussing whether the soul could exist apart from the body. Perhaps in reaction Walter became a part-time sandal maker. He would sit at his wooden bench, cut leather, and sew sandals with an awl. With his long, thin legs sticking up as he sat on his bench, he looked like Geppetto, Pinocchio's creator, and in lieu of diaphanous words you had a pair of sandals that lasted until you lost them.<br><br> Of the three daughters, Nan was the middle one, and the most fr&#x160;ulein. She had a merry face with flawless skin untouched by sun and nourished by snow. She had straight black hair and observant, very blue eyes. She was tall, healthy, and young, and she gave me my first taste of Slow.<br><br> She would get into the tins of wheat, rye, and beans and make up recipes for bread. She might grind the wheat with the rye and then add nuts, cumin, even red pepper. This particular time she did not even use yeast.<br><br> I was sitting at the table and watching her as she kneaded the coarse flour with her hands. She worked the dough in a kind of abstraction, then formed it into a loaf and put it in the oven. It didn't rise, of course, without yeast, but its smell filled the kitchen and people began to appear from around the house, drawn by its fragrance.<br><br> Finally Nan took the loaf out of the oven. It was small, dense, and primitive, and I'd never seen bread like that. The only bread I knew was Wonder Bread. I watched as she sliced the loaf in the thinnest of slices and then we spread it with the butter she'd also made with the cream Jane had bought from a faraway organic dairy. I had never tasted anything like it. It was gritty, salty, peppery. It took me a long time to chew and had many flavors, and as I tasted, I suddenly understood why, in all the diets I'd ever known, bread was bad for you, and yet the Bible called bread the "staff of life." The Bible didn't mean Wonder Bread but Nan's bread. Perhaps for the dietician, the difference between the two breads is simply in price and nutritional content, but to my palate, they were not even comparable, the difference between them being so obvious, and yet indefinable.<br><br> That was my first taste of Slow.<br><br> I met Meg, daughter number one, when she decided to come home. She�d run off with her ex-Vietnam-medic boyfriend Peter, but then, several months into my stay, Jane announced that Meg was pregnant and was moving back into my bedroom so she could give birth on the teak deck, or, in bad weather, in bed. Which she did, soon enough.<br><br> In the meantime, I was out of a bedroom. But I didn't want to leave. That place was a master's degree in the future. There were the Indian gurus, the organic food, Walter's new technologies. There were the discussions at the dinner table about physics, time, politics; draft resisting, civil disobedience, and government propaganda. There were the marijuana brownies; there was Steve Jobs's little box where you could make phone calls for free; there were the horses, the chickens and our own eggs. We were vegetarians. Walter knew wine. So I did not want to leave.<br><br> I looked around for where else I could sleep. I started with the storage room in the horse paddock, but I finally settled on the roof, which, thanks to Frank Lloyd Wright's architect-disciple, was flat. It, too, looked onto the Coast Range and it had large eaves I could move under when it rained, and there I lived until I finished college. It turned out to be a great place to sleep because all night long, I could watch the stars moving across the sky, and I had never seen that before.<br><br> Walter taught me the constellations he knew, and one night he explained to me about the "precession of the equinoxes." Because of the wobble of the earth's axis, every year the sky shifts eastward-about 1 degree every 70 years, 30 degrees every 2,000 years, and 360 degrees-one complete revolution-in approximately 26,000 years, which the ancients called the "Great Year." They had measured the precessional shift by whatever zodiacal constellation was appearing on the horizon at the spring equinox. There were twelve such constellations, and each spanned about 30 degrees, a different one appearing every 2,000 years. They believed that whichever constellation that was, characterized the 2,000-year epoch. For us it was Pisces, the Fishes, right above our heads.<br><br> Walter pointed it out to me-two not-very-bright stars the ancients envisioned as two fish swimming in opposite directions. The nature of Pisces was therefore, he said, dichotomy, strife, and war-and was what gave our age, the Age of Pisces, its characteristic quality of opposition. Now, however, the constellation of Aquarius was beginning to appear on the horizon, and that would mean a new age, with different strengths and weaknesses.<br><br> Often during those nights on the roof, I would wake up and look at the sky, and so I learned for myself how the Big Dipper turns around the North Star like a clock hand, and how the planets wander along the ecliptic. I saw for myself how Venus was some years the morning star in winter and the evening star in spring, and other years the opposite, and during those years I always knew where Mars was, and Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury. I could tell the day of the month by the moon, and the time of night by the stars.<br><br> Perhaps that seems of antiquarian interest only, but it was not. Learning the sky creates a special kind of time-not linear, scientific, progressive time, but seasonal, horticultural, circular time-would be crucial for me later on, when I discovered the Middle Ages and Hildegard of Bingen and their way of understanding the cosmos. Which was circular, not linear, the time of the seasons, which we still wear on our wrists-a revolutionary time, as in the Latin revolvere, to turn back, to turn around.<br><br> Meg gave birth not on the teak deck but in my ex-bedroom.<br><br> On the morning of the birth, she got up and announced that the baby would be born that day. Then she washed my car. Then she went into my ex-room and lay down on the bed and Peter lay down next to her. We gathered around and waited, and then after about two hours, Peter had her start to push. She did, and to my complete surprise, some black thing appeared between her legs, and two pushes later, an entire whole baby, a tiny infant girl, whom Peter did not slap and who did not cry and who breathed very fine without that.<br><br> It was stunning. It was like watching a rabbit being pulled out of a hat. There was nothing and then there was something. The tiny thing was covered with a sort of dust, and Jane took her away, cleaned her up, and put her naked next to Meg.<br><br> Then the afterbirth came. Meg said she'd heard that some Berkeley vegetarians saut ed and ate it-high in protein and good for your immune system-but we nixed the idea and Peter buried it in the backyard. Then she got up and we had dinner.<br><br> Later in medical school I would deliver quite a few babies, with IVs, needles and scissors, fetal scalp monitoring and epidurals. Despite the technology, there was always that same sense of sleight of hand-How did that get here? Of some amazing magician, who happened in those instances to be me. But there was never that sense of easiness of Meg's birthing, of rolling down a hill-of smoothness, inevitability, slowness.<br><br> By then I�d finished college and I didn�t know what to do next. Most of us didn�t, given the times, but especially the women didn�t. We had never thought that far ahead. We had seen that all the women we knew were wives and mothers, so presumably some kind of transformation would happen to us in college. But it hadn�t happened. I didn�t want to have a career as a wife. I didn�t want to get a PhD, either, which was the only other option I could think of. So instead I went traveling. That�s what we did. It wasn�t expensive then-three dollars got you a bed and a breakfast. I bought an open-ended plane ticket, flew to Europe, and spent months adventuring.<br><br> And then in an out-of-the-way bookstore I discovered what I would do next.</p><h2>Check, Please!

The novel was written by a first-time author, and the film option was snapped up by aging heartthrob Robert Redford for 3 million smackers. Why take such risks on a brand-spanking-new author? The answer becomes clear upon reading the touching tale.<p> One morning while teenage Grace Maclean is riding Pilgrim, her goofy, loveable pony, she has a horrendous glass-shattering, bone-splintering, ligament-lynching meeting with a megaton truck that leaves her and her four-legged friend damaged in mind, body, and spirit. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, her jaded, brilliant, bitchy mom, Annie Graves (Kristin Scott Thomas in the 1998 film) is working out a wrinkle in her self-absorbed existence when she gets a call at her plush, Manhattan office about Grace's accident. Racked with guilt, Graves makes it her calling to find the mythical horse whisperer, an equine Zen master who has the ability to heal horses (and broken souls) with soothing words and a gentle touch. Just when it seems he can't be found, what do you know, she finds him. He arrives in the form of Tom Booker-- a rugged, sensitive, dreamy cowboy who helps Pilgrim and Grace repair their fractured selves. To add more mesquite to fire, Booker has a way with not-so-injured, attractive, married women--like Annie. As the plot thickens, so does the familial strife, which threatens to undo Booker's healing work.</p><p> Like an expert cinematographer, Evans deftly crafts each scene with precision and clarity, sprinkling in ominous signs and foreboding images. For example, in the opening paragraphs, as Annie starts out on the tragic ride, she comes across a bloody bird wing that seems to have fallen out of nowhere. The weight of impending doom is further strengthened by the truck driver's bad luck--he has a run-in with the highway patrol just moments before his meeting with Grace and Pilgrim. These not-so-subtle subliminal messages are masterfully stitched in throughout the story and may compel readers to act as if they were watching a B-grade horror movie, shouting aloud, "Don't go there!" However sentimental, <i>The Horse Whisperer</i> is an engaging read, sort of like a finely tuned, well-edited film. <i>--Rebekah Warren</i></p><b>Nicholas Evans</b> studied law at Oxford University after serving in Africa with the Voluntary Service Overseas.

The last ten years have offered dramatic demonstrations of this theme. Just think of the breathtaking innovations in technology and digital culture. Ten years ago, Google was still a novelty; there were no smart phones, no IPods or IPads; no Twitter or Facebook or any of the social media that are transforming life and work today. Then think of the increasing pace of population growth, the growing strains on the environment and the effects of all of these on people&#x2019;s lives and future prospects and the fact is that the world is becoming more complex and unpredictable than ever. Ten years on, I wanted to refresh and update the information in the book and to show that these revolutionary changes make the arguments of Out of Our Minds even more urgent in 2011 than they were in 2001. I&#x2019;ve also spent the last ten years travelling the world presenting and debating the ideas in the book. In this new edition, I also wanted to present the arguments in a fresh way and to include new examples of the strategies that are needed to make them a practical reality. <br><br> <b>Why do you think this book is important for business and industry leaders as well as educationalists? </b><br> In the last ten years, I&#x2019;ve worked with business of all sorts all around the world. For all of them, cultivating creativity is a bottom line issue. Last fall, IBM published a report on the challenges facing business in 2011 and beyond. The report was based on survey of 3000 CEOs. It showed that the top priority for CEOs everywhere is to promote creativity systematically throughout their organizations. The reasons are clear enough. In a world of rapid change, companies and organizations have to be adaptable as circumstances change and be able to develop new products and services as new opportunities emerge. Most people occasionally have a new idea. For companies that isn&#x2019;t enough. To remain competitive, they need to develop cultures where creativity is a habit and innovation is routine. The new edition of Out of Our Minds sets out the core principles for doing this and for leading a dynamic and reliable culture of innovation. <br><br> <b>As one reviewer has suggested, creativity is a topic that excites some and enrages others. Why do you think this is? </b><br> I think it&#x2019;s because there are many misconceptions about creativity. Some people believe that creativity can&#x2019;t really be defined: others that it&#x2019;s a process that can&#x2019;t be taught. Some think it&#x2019;s about special people, or special activities. One of my aims in the book is to tackle these misconceptions and to show that everyone has creative potential and that creativity can be developed in every sort of activity and in a practical way. My argument throughout Out of Our Minds is not only that creativity can be developed systematically but that it must be in education and in business if we&#x2019;re to fulfil our real talents and meet the many challenges that we face. <br><br> <b>Since the publication of The Robinson Report for the UK Government in 1999, you have been invited to contribute to strategy for creative development by other international organisations and governments. How has this work influenced your arguments in the book? </b><br> The report for the UK government set out a national strategy to promote creativity systematically in schools. Following its publication I was asked to work on a similar strategy for Northern Ireland, as part of the Peace Process, and to contribute to Singapore&#x2019;s strategy to become the creative hub of South East Asia. I now live in the US and have worked with States here on creative strategies for business and education. All of these experiences have confirmed the basic arguments of Out of Our Minds and the principles and processes I describe in the book. They apply equally to schools, universities, companies and governments. Of course, there are always limits on what you can say in a government report. In this book, I&#x2019;ve been able to offer a much more personal and unfettered look at these issues and to speak from the heart as well as the mind. <br><br> <b>This book is a mind-opening look at why some people don&#x2019;t achieve their full potential in life. Do you feel you have achieved your full potential in your career? </b><br> I&#x2019;ve spent my life pursuing ideas and principles that I feel passionate about and that I know are deeply important in the lives of others. I&#x2019;m delighted that I&#x2019;ve had some impact around the world on education in particular and on how people and organizations think about themselves and their talents and potential. I still have a lot of life left in me though, so I&#x2019;ll defer judgement for a while on whether and when I&#x2019;ve achieved all I might do ...<br><br> <b>What changes do you hope <i>Out of Our Minds</i> will bring about in the long term? </b><br> I say in the Foreword to the new edition that &#x201c;my aims in this book are to help individuals to understand the depth of their creative abilities and why they might have doubted them; to encourage organizations to believe in their powers of innovation and to create the conditions where they will flourish; and to promote a creative revolution in education.&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t have put it better myself! <br></p><p>There is a paradox. As children, most of us think we are highly creative; as adults many of us think we are not. What changes as children grow up? Organizations across the globe are competing in a world that is changing faster than ever. They say they need people who can think creatively, who are flexible and quick to adapt. Too often they say they can't find them. Why not? In this provocative and inspiring book, Ken Robinson addresses three vital questions: <ul> <li> <b>Why is it essential to promote creativity?</b> Business leaders, politicians and educators emphasize the vital importance of promoting creativity andinnovation. Why does this matter so much? </li> <li> <b>What is the problem?</b> Why do so many people think they're not creative? Young children are buzzing with ideas. What happens as we grow up and go through school to make us think we arenot creative? </li> <li> <b>What can be done about it?</b> What is creativity? What can companies, schools and organizations do to develop creativity and innovation in a deliberate and systematic way? </li> </ul> <p>In this extensively revised and updated version of his bestselling classic, Out of Our Minds, Ken Robinson offers a groundbreaking approach to understanding creativity in education and in business. He argues that people and organizations everywhere are dealing with problems that originate in schools and universities and that many people leave education with no idea at all of their real creative abilities. Out of Our Minds is a passionate and powerful call for radically different approaches to leadership, teaching and professional development to help us all to meet the extraordinary challenges of living and working in the 21st century.</p><b>SIR KEN ROBINSON PhD</b> is an internationally recognized leader in the development of creativity, innovation and human resources.

Yet until now there has been no comprehensive text that incorporates the huge strides made in the subject over the past decade. <i>Development Economics</i> does precisely that in a clear, rigorous, and elegant fashion.</p><p>Debraj Ray, one of the most accomplished theorists in development economics today, presents in this book a synthesis of recent and older literature in the field and raises important questions that will help to set the agenda for future research. He covers such vital subjects as theories of economic growth, economic inequality, poverty and undernutrition, population growth, trade policy, and the markets for land, labor, and credit. A common point of view underlies the treatment of these subjects: that much of the development process can be understood by studying factors that impede the efficient and equitable functioning of markets. Diverse topics such as the new growth theory, moral hazard in land contracts, information-based theories of credit markets, and the macroeconomic implications of economic inequality come under this common methodological umbrella.</p><p>The book takes the position that there is no single cause for economic progress, but that a combination of factors--among them the improvement of physical and human capital, the reduction of inequality, and institutions that enable the background flow of information essential to market performance--consistently favor development. Ray supports his arguments throughout with examples from around the world. The book assumes a knowledge of only introductory economics and explains sophisticated concepts in simple, direct language, keeping the use of mathematics to a minimum.</p><p><i>Development Economics</i> will be the definitive textbook in this subject for years to come. It will prove useful to researchers by showing intriguing connections among a wide variety of subjects that are rarely discussed together in the same book. And it will be an important resource for policy-makers, who increasingly find themselves dealing with complex issues of growth, inequality, poverty, and social welfare.</p><p>If you are instructor in a course that uses <i>Development Economics</i> and wish to have access to the end-of-chapter problems in <i>Development Economics</i>, please e-mail the author at debraj.ray@nyu.edu.

Once again Lois Burdett has woven her own brand of magic by transforming Shakespeare's complex verse into rhyming couplets. She has created a version of <b>Hamlet</b> especially for children, even as young as seven, and one that readers of all ages will enjoy. </p><p> At the appropriately named Hamlet Elementary School in Stratford, Ontario, where Burdett has taught for over 20 years, her students have created wonderful drawings of <b>Hamlet</b> to illustrate Burdett's fluid rhymes. The students' interpretations are vivid evidence of Burdett's clever ability to bring Shakespeare's complex characters and intricate plots to life for young people. </p></p><p><p><b> Shakespeare Can Be Fun! </b></p><p> Most students will be exposed to the works of Shakespeare, typically in high school. The language and content of the plays is seen as too difficult for younger children but primary children are underestimated as to what they can accomplish given the challenge. The study of Shakespeare has become an integral part of my grade two program at Hamlet School, in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. </p><p> When I first moved to Stratford, I had no intention of teaching Shakespeare to 7 and 8 year olds. Stratford is a beautiful city noted for its Shakespearean theatre and I was interested that the schools were all named after Shakespearean characters. I asked my class, "Who is William Shakespeare?" and "Why is our school called Hamlet?" Their answers were surprising. One thought he was a famous boxer. Another believed he was the President of Canada. A third student responded, "I don't know who William Shakespeare is. I don't know any of the big kids." It was the children's enthusiasm and excitement on making the connection between an historical figure and the name of their school, which led me to continue. Thirty years later I can't imagine teaching anywhere in the world and not introducing Shakespeare. The study provided tremendous growth, particularly in the area of language and communication and evolved into a learning experience of a lifetime. I have endeavored in my books and workshops for teachers to share the excitement of exploring with children, the timeless emotions and ideas of Shakespeare. </p><p> The comments of two of my children, written at various times in their daily journals show the lasting impression Shakespeare has had on them. </p><p> "Shakespeare is like a big piece of chocolate cake. Once you've started you wish you could go on and on forever, in a non-stopping dream." (Anika, age 7) </p><p> "William's incredible words are like a velvet silk coat that rap around his pure thoughts. His pen writes on like all colors of the wind." (Sean, age 7) </p><p> <b>Lois Burdett</b> is in great demand throughout North America and Europe for her workshops where she instructs educators how to familiarize young children with Shakespeare. Among other commendations, Lois Burdett has received <i>Encyclopedia Britannica's National Award for Early Childhood Education</i>, Canada's <i>Meritorious Service Medal</i>, the Canadian Teachers' Federation's <i>Hilroy Fellowship</i>, and two writers' awards. Burdett's many speaking engagements have included the International Reading Association and the National Council of Teachers of English. Her books, magazine articles, presentations and media interviews are testimony to her strong influence in the education community, where she has also been instrumental in helping teachers to incorporate Shakespeare into early grade curricula. </p></p><h2>Alive and Well: One Doctor&#39;s Experience With Nutrition in the Treatment of Cancer Patients</h2><p>This is one doctor&#39;s experience with nutrition in the treatment of cancer.

He tells of his ongoing battle with the medical establishment, but this is primarily the story of his alive-and-well patients, many of whom had been told by their previous doctors that they had only a few months to live. Medical case histories are included.</p><p>A superb story of one doctor&#39;s fight for the right to practice medicine in accordance with one&#39;s own conscience, and not with mainstream practices of drugs, surgery, and radiation.Dr. Philip E. Binzel has been practicing medicine for over forty years. He is a graduate of the Medical School at St. Louis University in Missouri and did his internship at Christ Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1955 he entered Family Practice in Washington Court House, Ohio, where he currently resides. <p>In 1974 he began to investigate the role of nutrition in human disorders and began to incorporate that knowledge into his medical practice. Based on personal experience, he developed a highly effective protocol for the treatment of a wide range of disorders, including cancer. This led him into conflict with mainstream medicine and he has been forced to fight for the right to practice medicine in accordance with his conscience.</p></p><h2>Professional Practice for Interior Designers</h2><p><p>This updated edition of the most comprehensive business guide for designers covers the interior design profession in a clear and well-organized style. From establishing a practice to managing a project, the reader progresses through all aspects of the business, whether in a small or large firm. The new edition includes additional information on ethics, as well as a companion website containing sample forms and other resources. This book is recommended by the NCIDQ as preparation for their professional registration examination.</p></p><p><br> <p><b>Five Important Success Points for a Successful Interior Design Practice</b></p> <br> <p> 1. <b>Remember that profit and revenue are not the same thing.</b> Even the sole practitioner working from home has operating expenses, and these expenses must be considered before realizing a profit. Profit occurs after business expenses for operations, such as salaries, rent, and travel are deducted from charges to the client. These operating expenses reduce profitability, just as not charging for shipment and delivery charges on any goods sold to clients. Thus, revenue is the amount of funds brought in via fees and sales of goods. That revenue by itself is NOT profit.</p> <p> 2. <b> Never begin design work without a contract signed by the client.</b> More than ever, clients today are looking for free advice. Offering design ideas before a contract has been executed can mean doing design for a client that goes to someone else for the completion of a project. Talk to the client about their needs, as it is the only way you can determine what the project is all about and how much to charge. Refrain from offering substantive design ideas until after a contract has been signed. If the client is reluctant to sign an agreement, they might also be reluctant to go forward with any design work.</p> <p> 3. <b> Use a clear scope of services.</b> The scope of services defines what you will do for the client. It determines how much you will charge&#x2014;and even how you might charge. It also creates the limits as to what will not be done, although these extra services can be included&#x2014;for an extra charge. The scope of services should be detailed in the order in which you will perform the work. This helps the client understand how the project will be done. Of course, you must be prepared to perform all the services you include in the scope discussion, or hire someone who can&#x2014;perhaps as a consultant.</p> <p> 4. <b> Prepare an Annual Plan.</b> An annual plan helps a design firm see clearly where it wants to go and what it wants to achieve during the coming year. Having direction helps the business owner make decisions on items such as: what jobs to take and which to pass up; appropriate fees for each job; marketing expenses and approaches; and to help make hiring decisions.</p> <p> 5. <b> Keep accurate time records.</b> Even if you don&#x2019;t charge by the hour, keep accurate time records. Recording time helps determine how long each type of project takes. This will help determine fees and other charges for similar projects. Time recording can also assist in determining if there are certain kinds of projects that take too much time for the amount of revenue earned. Many clients, especially those charged by the hour, will want to see time records when billed.

The text begins with an overview of physical activity, health, and chronic disease, followed by discussion of preliminary health screening and risk classification, including the principles of fitness assessment, exercise prescription, and exercise program design. The remainder of the text provides in-depth coverage of assessment and exercise prescription for each of five physical fitness components: cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular fitness (strength, endurance, and power), body composition, flexibility, and balance. </p> <p> In each chapter, key questions help readers focus on essential information. Key points, review questions, and key terms reinforce concepts and summarize chapter content. An instructor guide, test package, chapter quizzes, and presentation package plus image bank provide tools for lecture preparation, creative content delivery, and class assessment.

For this edition she has provided a new chapter on art of the last decade. Handsomely and generously illustrated, this book reveals a rich legacy of work by African American painters, sculptors, and graphic artists.<br><br>"Art historical scholarship is greatly advanced by Samella Lewis's <i>African American Art and Artists</i> in that it foregrounds the work of artists who have been influencing the texture of art in the United States during the last two decades of the 20th century. Throughout <i>African American Art and Artists</i>, Lewis interrogates the issue of identity by presenting the biographical sketch, which locates the individual artistic personality within a specific cultural background with its own peculiar dynamics, giving a face to two cities of Black American art. Without polemics Lewis presents women artists&#x2014;Edmonia Lewis to Allison Saar&#x2014;as principal players in constructing an African American visual arts legacy. Here Lewis sufficiently defines the visual arts in order that they may assume their rightful place alongside African American music, literature and folklore as cultural expressions that have helped to give American culture its distinct character."&#x2014;from the foreword by Floyd Coleman, Harvard University.</p><p>"Beginning with the arts produced in the Colonial period, Dr. Lewis documents and interprets the flow of creative productions of an important segment of the American population. Her book shows that the range of art produced by African American artists covers the entire spectrum of craft productions through painting, sculpture, and printmaking. There is a progressive development of style that not only reflects the trends in particular periods, but reveals an evolving pattern of indigenous qualities that are distinct. The art community in general and the African American community in particular are fortunate to have Dr. Samella Lewis, for she has developed unusual authority in the area of African American art. I know that <i>African American Art and Artists </i>will be of great value educationally and that it will offer a stimulating and rewarding experience to all who have the opportunity to share in its contents."&#x2014;Jacob Lawrence<b>Samella Lewis</b> is Emerita Professor of Art History, Scripps College, and author of <i>The Art of Elizabeth Catlett</i> (1984).</p><h2>Suspended Sentences: Three Novellas (The Margellos World Republic of Letters)</h2><p><b>A trio of intertwined novellas from the 2014 Nobel laureate for literature</b><br><br> In this essential trilogy of novellas by the winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Literature, French author Patrick Modiano reaches back in time, opening the corridors of memory and exploring the mysteries to be encountered there. Each novella in the volume--<i>Afterimage</i>, <i>Suspended Sentences</i>, and <i>Flowers of Ruin</i>&#x2014;represents a sterling example of the author&#x2019;s originality and appeal, while Mark Polizzotti&#x2019;s superb English-language translations capture not only Modiano&#x2019;s distinctive narrative voice but also the matchless grace and spare beauty of his prose.<br><br> Although originally published separately, Modiano&#x2019;s three novellas form a single, compelling whole, haunted by the same gauzy sense of place and characters. Modiano draws on his own experiences, blended with the real or invented stories of others, to present a dreamlike autobiography that is also the biography of a place. Orphaned children, mysterious parents, forgotten friends, enigmatic strangers&#x2014;each appears in this three-part love song to a Paris that no longer exists.<br><br> Shadowed by the dark period of the Nazi Occupation, these novellas reveal Modiano&#x2019;s fascination with the lost, obscure, or mysterious: a young person&#x2019;s confusion over adult behavior; the repercussions of a chance encounter; the search for a missing father; the aftershock of a fatal affair. To read Modiano&#x2019;s trilogy is to enter his world of uncertainties and the almost accidental way in which people find their fates.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Patrick Modiano</b>&nbsp;is a best-selling novelist and the winner of some of the most prestigious literary awards in France, including the Prix Goncourt and the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca for lifetime achievement. In 2014 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for "the art of memory with which he has evoked the most ungraspable human destinies and uncovered the life-world of the occupation." <b>Mark Polizzotti</b> has translated more than forty books from the French and is director of the publications program at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York."Vividly translated by Mark Polizzotti . . . [and] as good a place as any to enter the long, slow-moving river of Modiano&#x2019;s fiction."&#x2014;Alan Riding, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br>"A timely glimpse at [Modiano&#x2019;s] fixations . . . . In Mark Polizzotti&#x2019;s spare and elegant translation, the writing conveys a sense of dreamy unease in which the real, the hypothesized, and the half-forgotten blend into a shimmering vagueness."&#x2014;Sam Sacks, <i>Wall Street Journal</i><br>"An excellent place to begin. . . . Here is the bracing darkness at the heart of Modiano&#x2019;s vision of memory and modern day Paris, . . . a traveling back to travel forward, a journey these novellas pace with the elegance of a solitary walker, moving through a city&#x2019;s streets, his collar up against the cold."&#x2014;John Freeman, <i>Boston Globe</i><br>"The three novellas that make up<i> Suspended Sentences</i> offer a fine introduction to Modiano&#x2019;s later work."&#x2014;<i>The Economist</i><br>"Modiano is a pure original. He has transformed the novel into a laboratory for producing atmospheres, not situations&#x2014;where everything must be inferred and nothing can be proved."&#x2014;Adam Thirlwell, <i>The Guardian</i><br>"These three atmospheric novellas demonstrate the range of reading pleasure afforded by Modiano&#x2019;s approach and the dark romance of his Paris. . . . Each first-person novella is also a portrait of the artist."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br>"Haunting. . . . Modiano combines a detective&#x2019;s curiosity with an elegist&#x2019;s melancholy."&#x2014;Adam Kirsch, <i>New Republic</i><br>"[A] trilogy of novellas from the recent French Nobel Prize winner. . . . Fictions with a moral bite, depicting a world in which everyone, it seems, is complicit in crimes not yet specified. Moody, elegant and dour."&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews </i>(starred review)<br>"The three novellas that make up this exquisite collection are mysteries, albeit mysteries of an existential sort."&#x2014;David L. Ulin, <i>Los Angeles Times</i><br>"Compelling. . . . Haunting. . . . Modiano&#x2019;s unconventional accounts of vanished hours show how the urge to solve a long-lost crime, or to reclaim forgotten memories, ultimately leads to inscrutable vanishing points."&#x2014;Scott Esposito, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br>"Brilliant."&#x2014;<i>New York Magazine </i>"Approval Matrix"<br>"[A] welcome translation . . . [Modiano&#x2019;s] stories include suspenseful passages and are invariably absorbing . . . and offer much to ponder as one proceeds."&#x2014;John Taylor, <i>Arts Fuse</i><br>"Beautiful and fascinating."&#x2014;M.A. Orthofer, <i>Complete Review</i><br>"Striking and poignant."&#x2014;Kacy Muir, <i>Weekender</i><br>"The three novellas in<i> Suspended Sentences</i> offer a vivid glimpse into Modiano's photographic remembrance of things past."&#x2014;Brandon Ambrosino, <i>Vox</i><br>Patrick Modiano is the winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Literature<br>"Reading Modiano is like experiencing a very specific flavor you don&#x2019;t encounter every day&#x2014;saffron or asafetida, say. He&#x2019;s direct and precise, but also gently melancholy, like the squeezed essence of passing time. Mark Polizzotti&#x2019;s translation expertly catches the timbre of his voice."&#x2014;Luc Sante<br>"Haunting. Like a master perfumer, Nobel Prize winner Patrick Modiano has crafted a signature scent: his unmistakable blend of nostalgia, grief, love, disquiet, Paris. In any translation, exotic d�cor comes easy but to capture the atmosphere of the words is much harder &#x2014; Polizzotti succeeds beautifully in creating the impalpable magic of Modiano&#x2019;s world in English."&#x2014;Damion Searls<br>"Completely, insouciantly, Modiano describes the interiors and essential matter of the French literary imagination. In these fictions, the sworn bewilderment of intimacy as cause and quest and actual topography of narrative becomes an inexhaustible source. And from that source there flows a riverine voice of legends and documentary legerdemain: always candid, always fitly perplexed. In the three novellas gathered as <i>Suspended Sentences</i>, this voice elapses across Paris as it never was, yet somehow <i>must</i> have been. Otherwise, there could be no accounting for acrobats, for Edith Piaf, for collaboration and liberation and the spring of 1968. All of these and more Modiano addresses with a luminous bewilderment more intimately exacting and more precise than any certainty could be."&#x2014;Donald Revell, Author of <i>Pennyweight Windows: New &amp; Selected Poems</i><br>"The three novellas included in this volume by this year&#x2019;s Nobel Prize winner Patrick Modiano offer eloquent testimony to the writer&#x2019;s remarkable gift for evoking the power of the past over human lives and destinies, and the ephemeral and ultimately mysterious nature of human relationships. They also capture Modiano&#x2019;s unrivaled ability to describe in limpid and haunting prose the power of a place, Paris, and to make its history and geography come alive in new and unexpected ways. Beautifully translated by Mark Polizzotti, this small volume will familiarize Anglophone readers with the talent and genius of France&#x2019;s best- kept literary secret."&#x2014;Richard J. Golsan, Texas A&amp;M University<br>&#x201c;The Nobel Prize committee&#x2019;s abrupt elevation of Patrick Modiano to international prominence makes the publication of these three works particularly valuable; not only has very little of the author&#x2019;s work appeared in English, but Mark Polizzotti&#x2019;s long experience as editor, publisher, and translator, together with his truly astonishing familiarity with the French language, has advantageously equipped him to execute his finely-tuned English renderings of these discreetly complex texts. Modiano belongs to one of the great traditions of French fiction, inaugurated by Madame de Lafayette&#x2019;s <i>The Princess of Cleves</i>, continued (this is a <i>very </i>short list) in Marivaux&#x2019;s novels, later in Laclos&#x2019;s <i>Dangerous Liaisons</i> and Flaubert&#x2019;s <i>Three Tales </i>and <i>A</i><i>Sentimental Education</i>, in the 20th century variously developed by its three great Raymonds &#x2013; Radiguet, Roussel, and Queneau &#x2013; and, greatest of all, Marcel Proust, and in our own time flourishing anew in the pages of Patrick Modiano and Jean Echenoz. To the thousands of French readers of Modiano, declaring him a great writer is obvious, necessary, and inexplicable: he and his tradition depend on intimacy, precision, and a ruthless avoidance of reassuring conclusions &#x2013; that is, modest qualities. Modiano&#x2019;s tales are mostly centered on life in outlying parts of Paris during and after World War II; place and time are rendered with alluring exactness, as are their fugitive inhabitants, and all are then inevitably lost in a blur of evanescent clues that leave nothing but an hallucinatory melancholy behind: a melancholy that enchants a rediscovered world with mysterious, hopeless magic. Modiano has said of his work, &#x201c;I have always felt that I&#x2019;ve been writing the same book for the past 45 years&#x201d;; but each novel is unflaggingly fresh, with writing of exemplary purity, depending on nothing but itself for the reality it creates. Now, with <i>Suspended Sentences</i> in hand, you can enter this hauntingly vivid new world. I strongly urge you not to let the opportunity pass you by.&#x201d;&#x2014;Harry Mathews<br></p><h2>Mundo Real Level 1 Student&#39;s Book plus ELEteca Access (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Mundo Real is a three-level high school Spanish program that uses lively and compelling content, images, and video to teach the language that learners need to succeed in and outside the classroom.

You must inspect it carefully </p> <p> and prepare it as much as possible. </p> <p> </p> <p> There are three key physical considerations in speaking. They </p> <p> are (1) sound; (2) light; and (3) temperature. These are the three </p> <p> areas where things always go wrong in a speaking engagement. </p> <p> You have heard of Murphy&#x2019;s Law, which says that whatever can go </p> <p> wrong, will go wrong. This law was probably discovered by people </p> <p> who give talks and seminars in hotels and convention facilities. </p> <p> </p> <p> <b>Know the Lies People Tell </b> </p> <p> </p> <p> The first rule to know when holding any kind of public speaking </p> <p> function is that hotels lie. I learned this when I first began speaking </p> <p> and I have seen it proved over and again, 90 percent of the </p> <p> time. Hotels lie. </p> <p> </p> <p> It is almost as if the people who arrange facilities for conventions, </p> <p> seminars, and speeches have taken a special course in the </p> <p> various lies, distortions, and half-truths that they tell the meeting </p> <p> planners and speakers, especially on the day and at the moment </p> <p> of the presentation. </p> <p> </p> <p> Fire Regulations </p> <p> </p> <p> One of their favorites is &#x2018;&#x2018;fire regulations.&#x2019;&#x2019; They always say that </p> <p> they cannot do or change something because of fire regulations. </p> <p> The fact is that they do not want to change anything about the </p> <p> room or the setup. Their claim of &#x2018;&#x2018;fire regulations&#x2019;&#x2019; is invariably </p> <p> false, but it intimidates the inexperienced meeting planner into </p> <p> acquiescence. </p> <p> </p> <p> Whenever I hear this, I simply say, &#x2018;&#x2018;My father is a fire inspector, </p> <p> and I am quite familiar with the fire regulations. Please show </p> <p> me where in the regulations it says you are not allowed to arrange </p> <p> the room in this way.&#x2019;&#x2019; This always stuns them. They immediately </p> <p> drop the excuse and begin to cooperate. I&#x2019;ve seen this happen over </p> <p> and over again, in hundreds of facilities. </p> <p> </p> <p> &#x2018;&#x2018;It&#x2019;s Computer Controlled&#x2019;&#x2019; </p> <p> </p> <p> Another excuse that they give you is that &#x2018;&#x2018;The lighting is computer </p> <p> controlled. There is nothing we can do about it until the engineer </p> <p> arrives.&#x2019;&#x2019; </p> <p> </p> <p> For some reason the engineer is never on the premises or immediately </p> <p> available. He or she is at a meeting, away on vacation, </p> <p> or dealing with another emergency. </p> <p> </p> <p> <b>How to Deal with the Lies People Tell</b> </p> <p> </p> <p> The key to succeeding in organizing the facilities is for you to be </p> <p> friendly, polite, and charming but simultaneously gently insistent </p> <p> with the staff. Your goal must be not to get them mad at you early </p> <p> in the process. They are the only ones who can help you. But here </p> <p> are some things you can do to get some results. </p> <p> </p> <p> Threaten Them If Necessary </p> <p> </p> <p> One day, I was doing a seminar in Tampa, Florida. The room temperature </p> <p> was 80 degrees. People were perspiring, waving their </p> <p> seminar materials as fans, and generally unhappy and dissatisfied. </p> <p> They were starting to leave and ask for their money back on the </p> <p> way out. </p> <p> </p> <p> I asked the organizer to call the hotel and have them turn the </p> <p> temperature down. She called them repeatedly, but to no avail. </p> <p> They gave all the usual excuses. &#x2018;&#x2018;The engineer is working on it; it </p> <p> is computer controlled; we are doing everything we can.&#x2019;&#x2019; </p> <p> </p> <p> Finally, at the break, I called the head office and told them that </p> <p> if the temperature did not come down and the air conditioner was </p> <p> not turned on within two minutes, we would cancel the seminar, </p> <p> refuse to pay for the room, and sue them for lost revenues. It was </p> <p> amazing. As I stood there, I could feel the air conditioning coming </p> <p> on. After pleading with them for two hours and listening to every </p> <p> excuse imaginable, as soon as we threatened not to pay, the air </p> <p> conditioning roared on and stayed on for the rest of the function. </p> <p> </p> <p> Refuse to Pay </p> <p> </p> <p> I always encourage my clients to call someone in charge and tell </p> <p> the person, &#x2018;&#x2018;We will not pay for the room if the air conditioning </p> <p> or temperature is not adjusted immediately.&#x2019;&#x2019; In almost every </p> <p> case, all the technical difficulties that had been holding them back </p> <p> are suddenly resolved and the temperature is lowered or adjusted </p> <p> to the proper comfort level. </p> <p> </p> <p> <b>Check the Lighting</b> </p> <p> </p> <p> Lighting is very important in a seminar presentation. The total attention </p> <p> of the audience should be on your face, with only casual </p> <p> side-glances to your props. Remember that 70 percent of the people </p> <p> in your audience are &#x2018;&#x2018;visuals.&#x2019;&#x2019; They can only process information </p> <p> if they can see it. The other 30 percent are &#x2018;&#x2018;auditories.&#x2019;&#x2019; These </p> <p> are people who process information only when they can hear it </p> <p> clearly. Your job is to cater to and satisfy both groups. </p> <p> </p> <p> Fifty percent of the time, the lighting will be wrong in some </p> <p> way when you arrive to do your presentation. For this reason, you </p> <p> always want to arrive early enough so that you can check out the </p> <p> lighting thoroughly before you go on stage. If something is wrong </p> <p> with the lighting when you begin to speak, it is almost impossible </p> <p> to make any changes afterward. </p> <p> </p> <p> Where to Put the Lights </p> <p> </p> <p> In stage or TV productions, people spend one or two days in advance </p> <p> just setting up the lights. They arrange the lighting and </p> <p> move it around so that there are no shadows on the stage or on </p> <p> the actors. They make sure that every single person is absolutely </p> <p> clear to every single participant in the audience, from every angle. </p> <p> This is the ideal. </p> <p> </p> <p> As the speaker, you must be fully lit, 100 percent of the time </p> <p> from both sides so there are no shadows on your face. It is not </p> <p> unusual for the facility to have lights that beam on you from the </p> <p> top rather than from the front, shading out the bottom half of your </p> <p> face. This causes a negative audience reaction. </p> <p> </p> <p> The Phantom of the Opera </p> <p> </p> <p> On one speaking occasion at a hotel, we asked for additional lighting </p> <p> and the hotel told us (remember, hotels lie) that it could only </p> <p> find one spotlight. The hotel staff brought it into the room and set </p> <p> it up to one side at the rear of the audience. This spotlight shone </p> <p> on one half of my face, giving me a &#x2018;&#x2018;Phantom of the Opera&#x2019;&#x2019; look </p> <p> for my entire presentation. </p> <p> </p> <p> The reaction from the audience was immediate and negative. </p> <p> People actually became angry. They criticized the talk and demanded </p> <p> their money back. They walked out. For some reason, the </p> <p> half-faced lighting made me look sinister and evil and the people </p> <p> reacted in a negative way. We never made the mistake of having </p> <p> only one light again. </p> <p> </p> <p> Your Face Is All-Important </p> <p> </p> <p> When I organize lighting for a seminar, I tell the technicians that </p> <p> a person in the back row should be able to see a zit on my face </p> <p> from where she is sitting. I emphasize that the lighting on the </p> <p> stage should be as bright as an operating theatre. They often nod </p> <p> and pretend to agree but secretly think that you don&#x2019;t know what </p> <p> you&#x2019;re talking about. You must therefore be insistent. </p> <p> </p> <p> In many cases, the staff will set up your stage and podium for </p> <p> the convenience of the screens rather than to illuminate the </p> <p> speaker clearly. The staff members will say, &#x2018;&#x2018;If we turn on all the </p> <p> lights, it will wash out the screen.&#x2019;&#x2019; Be alert to this because it happens </p> <p> all the time. Insist that you don&#x2019;t care how the screens look. </p> <p> The light on your face is what counts. </p> <p> </p> <p> Check in Ahead of Time </p> <p> </p> <p> I was giving a seminar in Irvine, California, a couple of years ago. </p> <p> My seminar was for the entire afternoon, and, as usual, I arrived in </p> <p> the middle of the morning so I could watch the previous speakers. </p> <p> </p> <p> When I walked into the room, a first-class Hyatt hotel facility, </p> <p> it was only half lit. It was a form of semidarkness, almost like a </p> <p> nightclub. The speaker was visible in a hazy, distant sort of way. I </p> <p> was appalled. </p> <p> </p> <p> I immediately brought one of the hotel staff members to the </p> <p> room. I said, &#x2018;&#x2018;Is there any way you can turn up the lighting in this </p> <p> room?&#x2019;&#x2019; He said, &#x2018;&#x2018;Oh, did you want the lighting up full?&#x2019;&#x2019; </p> <p> </p> <p> When I said yes, he immediately went to a wall panel, touched </p> <p> a couple of buttons, and the whole room became fully lit, classroom </p> <p> style. It was a shock to me and to everyone in the audience. </p> <p> They had been straining to see and get the message of the speaker </p> <p> for the last two hours. </p> <p> </p> <p> It&#x2019;s Not a Nightclub Performance </p> <p> </p> <p> This has become a common refrain for me. Whenever I go to a </p> <p> speaking engagement, I tell them that I want all the lights on full. </p> <p> I tell them, &#x2018;&#x2018;This is not a nightclub performance.&#x2019;&#x2019; </p> <p> </p> <p> It is amazing to me how many professional lighting techni- </p> <p> cians think that the speaker wants the audience to be darkened </p> <p> while the speaker is so brightly lit that he or she cannot see people </p> <p> in the audience because of the glaring light in his eyes. The other </p> <p> problem with this is that the audience views the speaker more as </p> <p> an entertainer. People sit quietly to watch the performance, not </p> <p> wanting to make any noise. They do not respond or interact with </p> <p> the speaker. The audience sits almost like a mole peering out of </p> <p> its hole at the speaker lit up on the stage. </p> <p> </p> <p> Remember, unless you are a professional entertainer in a </p> <p> nightclub, you want what is called &#x2018;&#x2018;one hundred candle power at </p> <p> desk level.&#x2019;&#x2019; This means that the entire room should be as bright </p> <p> as a schoolroom. You want people to be able to see one another, </p> <p> see you clearly, and take notes on the subject you are discussing. </p> <p> This is essential for audience enjoyment and satisfaction. </p></p><h2>Hiding Place</h2><p>The amazing story of Corrie ten Boom, a heroine of the Dutch Resistance who helped Jews escape from the Nazis and became one of the most remarkable evangelists of the 20th century, is told in her classic memoir, now retold for a new generation.</p><p>Corrie Ten Boom stood naked with her older sister Betsie, watching a concentration camp matron beating a prisoner."Oh, the poor woman," Corrie cried."Yes.

Their rampant nature and sheer numbers appear to overtake fragile native species and forever change the ecosystems that they depend on. Concerns that invasive species represent significant threats to global biodiversity and ecological integrity permeate conversations from schoolrooms to board rooms, and concerned citizens grapple with how to rapidly and efficiently manage their populations. These worries have culminated in an ongoing &#x201c;war on invasive species,&#x201d; where the arsenal is stocked with bulldozers, chainsaws, and herbicides put to the task of their immediate eradication. In Hawaii, mangrove trees (Avicennia spp.) are sprayed with glyphosate and left to decompose on the sandy shorelines where they grow, and in Washington, helicopters apply the herbicide Imazapyr to smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) growing in estuaries. The &#x201c;war on invasive species&#x201d; is in full swing, but given the scope of such potentially dangerous and ecologically degrading eradication practices, it is necessary to question the very nature of the battle.&nbsp;<br> <br> <em>Beyond the War on Invasive Species</em> offers a much-needed alternative perspective on invasive species and the best practices for their management based on a holistic, permaculture-inspired framework. Utilizing the latest research and thinking on the changing nature of ecological systems, <em>Beyond the War on Invasive Species</em> closely examines the factors that are largely missing from the common conceptions of invasive species, including how the colliding effects of climate change, habitat destruction, and changes in land use and management contribute to their proliferation. <em>Beyond the War on Invasive Species</em> demonstrates that there is more to the story of invasive species than is commonly conceived, and offers ways of understanding their presence and ecosystem effects in order to make more ecologically responsible choices in land restoration and biodiversity conservation that address the root of the invasion phenomenon. The choices we make on a daily basis&#x2015;the ways we procure food, shelter, water, medicine, and transportation&#x2015;are the major drivers of contemporary changes in ecosystem structure and function; therefore, deep and long-lasting ecological restoration outcomes will come not just from eliminating invasive species, but through conscientious redesign of these production systems.</p></p><p><p>Tao Orion is a permaculture designer, teacher, homesteader, and mother living in the southern Willamette Valley of Oregon.

General readers, graduate students, researchers/faculty, and professionals/practitioners.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Library Journal</em>, Starred Review-</strong></p> <p>"Here is a brilliant, alternative way of dealing with nonnative, invasive species. Oregon State University permaculturist Orion&#x2019;s emphasis is on plants, and her survey of relevant literature is a virtuoso incorporation of books, journals, electronic resources, and personal communications, written in commendable expository prose. In the face of overwhelming political correctness, which dictates that invasive species should be eliminated, the author offers ways to exploit and adapt to them in addition to extolling the virtues some of the species exhibit. As an instructor, Orion teaches ways to manage ecosystems with an eye to long-term results, free of herbicides and destructive attempts to remove species seen as undesirable. She pays special attention to the behaviors of&nbsp;&#x2018;primitive' societies in relation to their surroundings. In her view, pre-Columbian America was already far from pristine; it underwent many changes wrought by Native Americans, especially through fire. This thoughtful, controversial, and well-documented book is guaranteed to infuriate many and to provoke us into rethinking our attitudes about what is natural and best for the land. With essays such as 'The Myth of Wilderness,' the reader is challenged to confront revolutionary ideas about our landscapes. <strong>VERDICT</strong>:&nbsp;Ideal for all interested in natural history, agriculture, chemicals, climate change, ecology, and anthropology.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Booklist</em>-</strong></p> <p>"Ecosystem restoration, broadly defined as reinstating native flora and fauna by controlling invasive species, is a noble goal. But in the case of plants, it is often achieved through the use of harsh pesticides.&nbsp;This irony is not lost on botanist Orion, who encourages fellow environmental professionals to factor in&nbsp;the larger picture and &#x201c;turn on the macroscope&#x201d; to meet desired end goals. Systematically pointing out avenues for improvement in our approach to restoration, from consuming more local foods to changing&nbsp;how we work with &#x201c;pristine&#x201d; nature, Orion provides us with a practical worksheet that takes the&nbsp;permaculture view, a holistic way of looking at habitat. This slender volume might be too &#x201c;textbookish&#x201d; to be accessible to the lay reader but Orion&#x2019;s reminders that the very definition of &#x201c;native&#x201d; is in flux (a process exacerbated by climate change) and her eco-friendly suggestions about what to do with &#x201c;unwanted&#x201d; species should be essential reading for all. Plenty of real-world instances of invasive flora and fauna (e.g., kudzu, zebra mussels) make the case effectively.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Some of our most productive and tasty plants in the permaculture landscape are vilified as invasive weeds that need controlling. This is a mindset that also promotes a delineation between conservation and agriculture. My personal response is to cultivate fewer conventional annual vegetables and grow and eat as many of these weeds as is appropriate, creating an extensive, diverse, and resilient forage system in my own backyard. It is time to stop putting land management into boxes and create wildlife habitats and food in stacked systems.</p> <p>"Tao Orion explains how to take advantage of the vigor of &#x2018;invasive&#x2019; edible and useful exotics and harvest them. This is how to bring ecosystems back into balance. This is adaptive permaculture thinking at the broad-scale level. Chelsea Green has produced yet another pioneering book, demonstrating how permaculture is way ahead of conventional land-management practices.&#x201d;<strong>--Maddy Harland, editor of <em>Permaculture</em> magazine, cofounder of The Sustainability Centre in the UK, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;An interesting and valuable contribution to the ongoing refutation of invasive species ideology. Detailed and wide-ranging, Orion extends and deepens several analyses of invasionism, and offers several interesting new perspectives. She points to holistic systems management as an alternative to the current war on invasives. Land managers and invasionists would do well to give it a careful read.&#x201d;<strong>--D.I. Theodoropoulos, author of <em>Invasion Biology: Critique of a Pseudoscience</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>Beyond the War on Invasive Species</em>&nbsp;creates an essential pathway for deeper care of the Earth. The holistic perspective of invasives is shared through deep experience and thoughtfulness and ultimately leads us to a greater and more aligned role in restoration of our home&#x2019;s ecosystems in these changing times. This book offers a critical role in civilization&#x2019;s evolution and highlights actions that recognize deeper values that benefit our society as a whole.&#x201d;<strong>--Katrina Blair, author of <em>The Wild Wisdom of Weeds: 13 Essential Plants for Human Survival</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;In her fascinating and highly readable book,<em> Beyond the War on Invasive Species</em>, author Tao Orion points out the shortcomings of our current approach toward landscape restoration and invasive species. Rather than seeing these exotic plants and animals simply as invaders that need to be eradicated, she argues, we should recognize the beneficial role they play in the environment and the many essential services they could provide to human beings. &#x201c;Embracing rampancy,&#x201d; as Orion exuberantly puts it, turns the perceived problem of invasive species into practical solutions that also allow us to make peace with both the land and ourselves.&#x201d;<strong>--Larry Korn, author of <em>One-Straw Revolutionary: The Philosophy and Work of Masanobu Fukuoka</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;This book brings much-needed balance to the overheated debate about so-called invasive species. Tao Orion&#x2019;s meticulously researched yet engaging work shows that the true culprits are nearly always human-caused disturbance and development, and that species shifts are a symptom, not a cause, of this habitat destruction. <em>Beyond the War on Invasive Species</em> is an important book that offers a path away from unsuccessful restoration efforts&#x2015;based on poor science and policy&#x2015;and toward new, ecologically sound programs for building and preserving biodiversity.&#x201d;<strong>--Toby Hemenway, author of <em>Gaia&#x2019;s Garden: A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture</em> and <em>The Permaculture City</em>: <em>Regenerative Design for Urban, Suburban, and Town Resilience</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>Beyond the War on Invasive Species</em> is part of a new, much more nuanced conversation about &#x2018;invasive&#x2019; species that is taking place in science, agriculture, and land management. It provides an analysis of the new science that looks for ecosystem function as well as harm from newly arrived species, looks at species migration in the context of climate change, and broadens our conversation to look at these organisms in the context of the human ecological footprint. Orion offers land management guidelines, based in permaculture design process, that help to chart a new way forward in our new land of novel ecosystems.&#x201d;<strong>--Eric Toensmeier, author of <em>Paradise Lot</em> and <em>Perennial Vegetables</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Tao Orion has brought together personal experience, careful study, and visionary thinking to turn us toward becoming useful people of place. Her exploration widens the narrow concept of invasion (so often repeated but seldom carefully thought through) and elucidates the trouble of short sightedness.&nbsp;We are not threatened by aliens, but rather we are turning our backs on the big picture.&#x201d;<strong>--Tom Ward, author of&nbsp;<em>Greenward, Ho!

Rich was both a gifted colleague and a valued friend who will be greatly missed. We extend our sympathies to his family. </p> <p> Obituary from the <i>Arizona Daily Star</i>: </p> <blockquote> <b>STEVENS, W. Richard</b>, noted author of computer books died on September 1. He is best known for his "UNIX Network Programming" series (1990, 1998, 1999), "Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment" (1992), and "TCP/IP Illustrated" series (1994, 1995, 1996). Richard was born in 1951 in Luanshya, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), where his father worked for the copper industry. The family moved to Salt Lake City, Hurley, New Mexico, Washington, DC and Phalaborwa, South Africa. Richard attended Fishburne Military School in Waynesboro, Virginia. He received a B.SC. in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Michigan in 1973, and an M.S. (1978) and Ph.D. (1982) in Systems Engineering from the University of Arizona. He moved to Tucson in 1975 and from then until 1982 he was employed at Kitt Peak National Observatory as a computer programmer. From 1982 until 1990 he was Vice President of Computing Services at Health Systems International in New Haven, CT, moving back to Tucson in 1990. Here he pursued his career as an author and consultant. He was also an avid pilot and a part-time flight instructor during the 1970's.<p> He is survived by his loving wife of 20 years, Sally Hodges Stevens; three wonderful children, Bill, Ellen and David; sister, Claire Stevens of Las Vegas, NV; brother, Bob and wife Linda Stevens of Dallas, TX; nieces, Laura, Sarah, Collette, Christy; and nephew, Brad. He is predeceased by his parents, Royale J. Stevens (1915-1984); and Helen Patterson Stevens (1916-1997). Helen lived in Tucson from 1991-1997, and Royale lived here in the early 1930's attending Tucson High School while his father was treated for TB at the Desert Sanitorium (now TMC). The family asks that in lieu of flowers, donations be made in Richard's name to Habitat for Humanity, 2950 E. 22nd Street, Tucson, AZ 85713. A memorial service for Richard will be held at St. Phillip's in the Hills Episcopal Church on Tuesday, September 7th at 12:00 noon. Following the service there will be a reception in the Murphy Gallery of the Church. Please wear colorful clothing to the service; Richard loved colors.</p></blockquote> <p> <b>W. Richard Stevens</b> was an acknowledged UNIX and networking expert and the highly-respected author of several books. He was also a sought-after instructor and consultant.</p> <br> <br> 020163354XAB04062001<p> </p><p> </p><p><b>Introduction</b></p>This book describes and presents the source code for the common reference implementation of TCP/IP: the implementation from the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at the University of California at Berkeley. Historically this has been distributed with the 4.x BSD system (Berkeley Software Distribution). This implementation was first released in 1982 and has survived many significant changes, much fine tuning, and numerous ports to other Unix and non-Unix systems. This is not a toy implementation, but the foundation for TCP/IP implementations that are run daily on hundreds of thousands of systems worldwide. This implementation also provides router functionality, letting us show the differences between a host implementation of TCP/IP and a router.<p>We describe the implementation and present the entire source code for the kernel implementation of TCP/IP, approximately 15,000 lines of C code. The version of the Berkeley code described in this text is the 4.4BSD-Lite release. This code was made publicly available in April 1994, and it contains numerous networking enhancements that were added to the 4.3BSD Tahoe release in 1988, the 4.3BSD Reno release in 1990, and the 4.4BSD release in 1993. (App sourceB describes how to obtain this source code.) The 4.4BSD release provides the latest TCP/IP features, such as multicasting and long fat pipe support (for high-bandwidth, long-delay paths). {Fig 1.1} (p. 4) provides additional details of the various releases of the Berkeley networking code.</p><p> This book is intended for anyone wishing to understand how the TCP/IP protocols are implemented: programmers writing network applications, system administrators responsible for maintaining computer systems and networks utilizing TCP/IP, and any programmer interested in understanding how a large body of nontrivial code fits into a real operating system.</p><p> </p><p><b>Organization of the Book</b></p> We take a bottom-up approach to the TCP/IP protocol suite, starting at the data-link layer, then the network layer (IP, ICMP, IGMP, IP routing, and multicast routing), followed by the socket layer, and finishing with the transport layer (UDP, TCP, and raw IP). <p><b>Intended Audience</b></p> This book assumes a basic understanding of how the TCP/IP protocols work. Readers unfamiliar with TCP/IP should consult the first volume in this series, Stevens 1994, for a thorough description of the TCP/IP protocol suite. This earlier volume is referred to throughout the current text as Volume 1. The current text also assumes a basic understanding of operating system principles.<p> We describe the implementation of the protocols using a data-structures approach. That is, in addition to the source code presentation, each chapter contains pictures and descriptions of the data structures used and maintained by the source code. We show how these data structures fit into the other data structures used by TCP/IP and the kernel. Heavy use is made of diagrams throughout the text - there are over 250 diagrams. This data-structures approach allows readers to use the book in various ways. Those interested in all the implementation details can read the entire text from start to finish, following through all the source code. Others might want to understand how the protocols are implemented by understanding all the data structurestand reading all the text, but not following through all the source code.</p><p>We anticipate that many readers are interested in specific portions of the book and will want to go directly to those chapters. Therefore many forward and backward references are provided throughout the text, along with a thorough index, to allow individual chapters to be studied by themselves. The inside back covers contain an alphabetical cross-reference of all the functions and macros described in the book and the starting page number of the description. Exercises are provided at the end of the chapters; most solutions are in Appendix A to maximize the usefulness of the text as a self-study reference.</p><p> </p><p><b>Source Code Copyright </b></p>All of the source code presented in this book, other than Figures 1.2 and 8.27, is from the 4.4BSD-Lite distribution. This software is publicly available through many sources (Appendix B).

Sound familiar? His name was Daniel, and with the power of hope, humility, and wisdom, he not only thrived, he changed an empire while he was at it. Though he lived thousands of years ago, he has a much to teach us today.&nbsp;<b>Even in Babylon, God Is in Control</b>&nbsp;In <i>Thriving in Babylon,</i> Larry Osborne explores the &#x201c;adult&#x201d; story of Daniel to help us not only survive &#x2013; but actually thrive in an increasingly godless culture. Here Pastor Osborne looks at:&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why panic and despair are never from God-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What true optimism looks like-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How humility disarms even our greatest of enemies-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why respect causes even those who will have nothing to do with God to listen-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How wisdom can snatch victory out of the jaws of defeat&nbsp;For those who know Jesus and understand the full implications of the cross, the resurrection, and the promises of Jesus, everything changes &#x2013; not only in us, but also in our world.</p><p><b>Dr. Larry Osborne</b>has served as a senior pastor and teaching pastor at North Coast Church&#x2014;one of the ten most influential churches in the country&#x2014;since 1980.

But how can that be possible? Why would God love you so? Because He has fashioned an unbreakable covenant between Himself and you. And He always keeps His promises. &#x201c;Everything God does,&#x201d; says Kay Arthur, &#x201c;is based on His covenant.&#x201d; And when you understand how thoroughly the dynamic concept of covenant permeates everything God says in His Word, and everything He does in our lives, you&#x2019;ll come to experience one of the most stabilizing, most freeing truths you&#x2019;ll ever know.<br><br>In a culture in which unfaithfulness is rampant, God&#x2019;s &#x201c;fierce, ferocious loyalty&#x201d; toward us is difficult to imagine. And yet, through her characteristically warm and wise exploration of the Scripture, Kay Arthur will lead you into discovering the stunning truth of God&#x2019;s covenant&#x2013;and help you experience its revolutionary truth in your life.<br><br>The Bible reveals the covenant bond to be the highest personal relationship possible. In ancient times, covenants were solemn, binding agreements supremely honored above all others. Making a covenant represented an unqualified, total commitment of one person to another&#x2013;unconditionally, totally, eternally.<br>As you follow the thread of God&#x2019;s covenant woven throughout the Bible, you&#x2019;ll discover the awesome privilege of getting to know the Lord as your Covenant God.</p><p><b>Kay Arthur</b> is perhaps the best-known and most-beloved woman Bible teacher in America today. The co-founder of Precept Ministries, based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Kay is the author of a number of books and an internationally known Bible teacher and conference speaker. She&#x2019;s also the host of a national radio broadcast. Each year, Kay reaches hundreds of thousands of people from a wide variety of denominations through Precept Bible Studies held in churches across the U.S. and around the world.Popular Bible teacher Arthur, cofounder of Precept Ministries, traces the idea of God's covenant from the Old and New Testaments to its meaning for people in the 20th century. She begins by reflecting on the first sign of God's covenant with humankind in the story of Noah and the flood. She then explores the ramifications of the covenant relationship between David and Jonathan, before focusing her attention on Jesus Christ as the mediator of the New Covenant. She notes, "A covenant relationship supersedes all other relationships. If you are in covenant with Jesus Christ, you are in covenant with One who is God." Using anecdotes from her own ministry experiences as well as a deep reading of Scriptures, Arthur explains the seriousness of making a covenant, especially in an age she sees as marked by casual commitments and broken promises. While readers will benefit from the depth of her study, her saccharine and manipulative style will put off many readers. For example, Arthur notes, "Beloved Christ laid down his life for you... His potential covenant partner, and you are to do the same."<br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Cambridge Illustrated History of China</h2><p>More populous than any other country on earth, China also occupies a unique place in our modern world for the continuity of its history and culture. In this sumptuously illustrated single-volume history, noted historian Patricia Ebrey traces the origins of Chinese culture from prehistoric times to the present. She follows its development from the rise of Confucianism, Buddhism, and the great imperial dynasties to the Mongol, Manchu, and Western intrusions and the modern communist state. Her scope is phenomenal--embracing Chinese arts, culture, economics, society and its treatment of women, foreign policy, emigration, and politics, including the key uprisings of 1919 and 1989 in Tiananmen Square. Both a comprehensive introduction to an extraordinary civilization, and an expert exploration of the continuities and disjunctures of Chinese history, Professor Ebrey&#39;s book has become an indispensable guide to China past and present. Patricia Ebrey is Professor of East Asian Studies and History and the author of Chinese Civilization: A Sourcebook (1993).</p><p>To compress 8,000 years of a civilization&#39;s life into a single volume is a daunting task, but University of Illinois historian Patricia Ebrey does the job with authority and considerable flair. Writing with an eye to explaining recurring themes in Chinese history, she discusses ideas of order and statecraft, resource allocation and use, imperialism and population growth. Along the way she makes interesting asides, noting, among other things, that the Mongol conquerors of China monopolized the bamboo trade because they did not want the ethnic Chinese to make weapons, and she gives stimulating overviews of such matters as the manufacture of silk, hardwood furniture, and ceramics.In an extraordinary feat of synthesis, Patricia Buckley Ebrey gives an engaging, full, gloriously illustrated account of over 8000 years of Chinese civilization--from prehistoric times through the rise of Confucianism, Buddhism and the imperial dynasties to the modern communist state. Everything appears, from the influence of leading Chinese historians, poets, novelists and dramatists to the impact of key philosophical and religious ideas, art forms, and the Mongul, Manchu and Western intrusions.</p><h2>Real Estate License Exams For Dummies</h2><p>Every year, thousands of Americans make the leap to an exciting, rewarding new career in real estate.

As a study of conspiracy and conspirators, of men caught in the desperate clash of ideologies, betrayal, expediency, and free will, Andre Malraux's novel remains unequaled.<br><br>Translated from the French by Haakon M. Chevalier</p><p><i>Man's Fate</i> was first published in 1933. As a fictional account of the early days of the Chinese Revolution, this novel remains a powerful expression of psychological insight into the spirit of political revolution. From the opening scene, in which Chinese terrorist Ch'en Ta Erh struggles internally over his task of assassinating a sleeping man, Malraux combines gritty action with an elaboration of the existential principle that social change is powered by the actions of individuals.<b>Andr�&nbsp;Malraux&nbsp;</b>(1901&#x2013;1976) was a French novelist, intellectual, art theorist, and statesman. His novels often explore the tension between political idealism and the existential realities of revolution.&nbsp;<i>La Condition humaine</i>&nbsp;(Man&#x2019;s Fate) is his most recognized work and won Le Prix Goncourt, France&#x2019;s most prestigious literary award, in 1933.

Here, Tenniel's fine line work is far crisper, delicate shadings are reproduced with more subtlety, and details never seen before are now visible.</p><p>This is a deluxe gift edition with clearer, more detailed images than have ever been seen before. At last, readers can see the Alice that Carroll and Tenniel had originally envisioned.</p><p>When Alice follows the White Rabbit down his rabbit hole she embarks on the adventure of a lifetime. As she travels through Wonderland Alice learns that in the magical land of the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the Queen of Hearts, nothing is as it first appears.</p></p><p>Source of legend and lyric, reference and conjecture, <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> is for most children pure pleasure in prose. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense.<p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

Drawing on the special relationship that the Native people of southeastern Alaska have always had with nature, <i>Blonde Indian</i> is a story about returning.<br><br> Told in eloquent layers that blend Native stories and metaphor with social and spiritual journeys, this enchanting memoir traces the author&#x2019;s life from her difficult childhood growing up in the Tlingit community, through her adulthood, during which she lived for some time in Seattle and San Francisco, and eventually to her return home. Neither fully Native American nor Euro-American, Hayes encounters a unique sense of alienation from both her Native community and the dominant culture. We witness her struggles alongside other Tlingit men and women&#x2014;many of whom never left their Native community but wrestle with their own challenges, including unemployment, prejudice, alcoholism, and poverty.<br><br> The author&#x2019;s personal journey, the symbolic stories of contemporary Natives, and the tales and legends that have circulated among the Tlingit people for centuries are all woven together, making <i>Blonde Indian</i> much more than the story of one woman&#x2019;s life. Filled with anecdotes, descriptions, and histories that are unique to the Tlingit community, this book is a document of cultural heritage, a tribute to the Alaskan landscape, and a moving testament to how going back&#x2014;in nature and in life&#x2014;allows movement forward.</p><p>Ernestine Hayes is an assistant professor of English at the University of Alaska Southeast.Hayes, now an English professor and historian of her mother's Lingit tribe, poignantly relates the sad details of her youth and early adulthood, adroitly interspersing these often-sordid memories with stories of tribal history that have been passed on for generations. Living alternately with an aunt and her maternal grandmother due to her mother's stay in a tuberculosis sanitarium, and with no siblings or father for support, Hayes learns to fend for herself, combing the docks near the cannery where her grandmother works for discarded fish heads for their evening soup. In and out of detention homes as a teenager and failed relationships as an adult, she eventually returns to Juneau and her roots. There Hayes reclaims her heritage, especially the Lingit worship of and reliance on the land and all it supports, a way of life she hope to pass on to her grandchildren. This sometimes raw, consistently honest memoir is a rewarding, evocative, ultimately uplifting view of Native life. <i>Deborah Donovan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Yeshua spoke Aramaic. Through the Aramaic language, his teachings offer not just another interpretation of the New Testament, but the unveiling of a secret message that attempts, once and for all, to settle centuries-old conceptions of sin, and to once again connect man with the heavenly spiritual source. The core of Yeshua&#x2019;s Aramaic message is intimacy, freedom, selfless awareness, unconditional love, compassion and forgiveness. In all he says, there exists a hidden invitation to us to be present in, and dedicated to, everything with which we engage. Five minutes of total devotion is worth more than hours of hectic exertion. The aim is to set mankind free and to dismiss everything that is bound up in false notions.</p><p><b>Lars Muhl</b> was for many years a successful singer/songwriter who, concurrently with his music, studied the world's religions and esoteric knowledge. Then, in 1996, he was struck down by an unexplained illness, which neither doctors nor alternative therapists could diagnose. For three years he was confined to his bed, unable to move. Through a friend, Lars was put in touch with a seer who, via the telephone, brought him "back to life." This experience, and the<br>revelations that followed from it, are described in <i>The O Manuscript</i><b>. </b> The author lives in Denmark."Lars Muhl, author of 'The O Manuscript' has surpassed himself with 'The Law of Light'. This is certainly his masterpiece: the teachings of Christ, a guide to a lightness of being which throws a different aspect on life and how to live it well. Like one of Jesus' apostles, Lars Muhl was given an inside into the Mysteries - the true message of Jesus and we have the privilege that he shares it with us. A book to be read and reread - an indispensable study guide to life." --Heidi Kay<br><br>"After almost 2000 years of the religious distortions of Yeshua's (Jesus) spiritual practice teachings, it is imperative that we recover the truth of his Aramaic words. No one does this &nbsp;with the beauty, the depth, and the clarity of Lars Muhl in his book, <i>The Law of Light. </i>There &nbsp;&nbsp;will not be a more important book released in the 21st century for the spiritual seekers who have chosen to live beyond the smallness of religion. Beyond religion, your life awaits your claiming it fully."&nbsp;--James A.

(Loeb Classical Library No. 218)</h2><p><p>Epictetus was a crippled Greek slave of Phrygia during Nero's reign (54&#x2013;68 CE) who heard lectures by the Stoic Musonius before he was freed. Expelled with other philosophers by the emperor Domitian in 89 or 92 he settled permanently in Nicopolis in Epirus. There, in a school which he called 'healing place for sick souls', he taught a practical philosophy, details of which were recorded by Arrian, a student of his, and survive in four books of Discourses and a smaller Encheiridion, a handbook which gives briefly the chief doctrines of the Discourses. He apparently lived into the reign of Hadrian (117&#x2013;138 CE).</p><p>Epictetus was a teacher of Stoic ethics, broad and firm in method, sublime in thought, and now humorous, now sad or severe in spirit. How should one live righteously? Our god-given will is our paramount possession, and we must not covet others'. We must not resist fortune. Man is part of a system; humans are reasoning beings (in feeble bodies) and must conform to god's mind and the will of nature.

Raised in the harsh Arabian Peninsula and orphaned while still a child, this unlikely leader and military genius received a calling to transform his society from a collection of raiding tribes into one of the world's most progressive societies. His message of monotheism and righteousness motivated an entire people to abandon idolatry and spread the word of God to surrounding nations. Although he was a military genius, his greatest accomplishments came from the religion he preached: Islam, which called its adherents to lead a life of prayer, charity, and contemplation.

Yet enfolded in these often poetic words is a utility that involves the complex associations derived from the evolution of the Chinese language and the vast array of therapeutic nalogies found in traditional medical works. <p>In discussing the point names, the authors examine the meaning, context, and significance of each acupuncture point to promote understanding of the point's use in acupuncture practice. Guidelines for understanding the nature and structure of the Chinese language are offered, along with discussions of the Chinese rationale for naming points and point groupings. The reasoning for selecting the English names is offered so that readers may adapt the names for their own use. Each of the 363 points covered is listed according to the system currently used in China. Descriptions include the name in Chinese characters, in Pinyin, and in English. The classical location according to major Chinese texts, the associated point groupings, an explanation of point functions, and classical energetic associations are also noted. Further detail is provided by inclusion of channel relationships, five-phase relationships, and qi functions. Additional notes detail linguistic and practical considerations that have accrued to the point over time. Alternate names for the point are given, again in Chinese, Pinyin, and English. Indexes provide stroke order listings, point group names, and point lists for each character. A glossary of all the characters used in point names provides a definition for each Chinese character.

The facts of his life, known from surviving documents, are sparse. He was one of eight children born to John Shakespeare, a merchant of some standing in his community. William probably went to the King&#x2019;s New School in Stratford, but he had no university education. In November 1582, at the age of eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway, eight years his senior, who was pregnant with their first child, Susanna. She was born on May 26, 1583. Twins, a boy, Hamnet ( who would die at age eleven), and a girl, Judith, were born in 1585. By 1592 Shakespeare had gone to London working as an actor and already known as a playwright. A rival dramatist, Robert Greene, referred to him as &#x201c;an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers.&#x201d; Shakespeare became a principal shareholder and playwright of the successful acting troupe, the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men (later under James I, called the King&#x2019;s Men). In 1599 the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men built and occupied the Globe Theater in Southwark near the Thames River. Here many of Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays were performed by the most famous actors of his time, including Richard Burbage, Will Kempe, and Robert Armin. In addition to his 37 plays, Shakespeare had a hand in others, including <i>Sir Thomas More</i> and <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, and he wrote poems, including <i>Venus and Adonis</i> and <i>The Rape of Lucrece</i>. His 154 sonnets were published, probably without his authorization, in 1609. In 1611 or 1612 he gave up his lodgings in London and devoted more and more time to retirement in Stratford, though he continued writing such plays as <b>The Tempest</b> and <b>Henry VII</b> until about 1613. He died on April 23 1616, and was buried in Holy Trinity Church, Stratford. No collected edition of his plays was published during his life-time, but in 1623 two members of his acting company, John Heminges and Henry Condell, put together the great collection now called the First Folio.</p><h2>CEB Common English Large Print Pew Bible, Navy</h2><p><p>This navy, large print Common English&nbsp;Pew Bible is ideal for repeated congregational worship with easy-to-see 12-point type, comfortable-to-read black-letter text, translation footnotes, and in-text subject headings.

The work is commonly known today as The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, or simply Jekyll &amp; Hyde. It is about a London lawyer named Gabriel John Utterson who investigates strange occurrences between his old friend, Dr. Henry Jekyll, and the evil Edward Hyde. The work is commonly associated with the rare mental condition often called "split personality", referred to in psychiatry as dissociative identity disorder, where within the same body there exists more than one distinct personality. In this case, there are two personalities within Dr. Jekyll, one apparently good and the other evil. The novella's impact is such that it has become a part of the language, with the very phrase "Jekyll and Hyde" coming to mean a person who is vastly different in moral character from one situation to the next.</p><p>The young Robert Louis Stevenson suffered from repeated nightmares of living a double life, in which by day he worked as a respectable doctor and by night he roamed the back alleys of old-town Edinburgh. In three days of furious writing, he produced a story about his dream existence. His wife found it too gruesome, so he promptly burned the manuscript. In another three days, he wrote it again. <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> was published as a "shilling shocker" in 1886, and became an instant classic. In the first six months, 40,000 copies were sold. Queen Victoria read it. Sermons and editorials were written about it. When Stevenson and his family visited America a year later, they were mobbed by reporters at the dock in New York City. Compulsively readable from its opening pages, <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> is still one of the best tales ever written about the divided self. <p> This University of Nebraska Press edition is a small, exquisitely produced paperback. The book design, based on the original first edition of 1886, includes wide margins, decorative capitals on the title page and first page of each chapter, and a clean, readable font that is 19th-century in style. Joyce Carol Oates contributes a foreword in which she calls Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde a "mythopoetic figure" like Frankenstein, Dracula, and Alice in Wonderland, and compares Stevenson's creation to doubled selves in the works of Plato, Poe, Wilde, and Dickens. </p><p> This edition also features 12 full-page wood engravings by renowned illustrator Barry Moser. Moser is a skillful reader and interpreter as well as artist, and his afterword to the book, in which he explains the process by which he chose a self-portrait motif for the suite of engravings, is fascinating. For the image of Edward Hyde, he writes, "I went so far as to have my dentist fit me out with a carefully sculpted prosthetic of evil-looking teeth. But in the final moments I had to abandon the idea as being inappropriate. It was more important to stay in keeping with the text and, like Stevenson, not show Hyde's face."

There were instead miles of desolate, uncultivated land; here and there rough-hewn paths over craggy hills or bleak moorland. Most of the roads left by the Romans would by then have become broken or overgrown, often fading into wilderness. Icy fogs hung over rivers and marshes, serving all too well the ogres that were then still native to this land. The people who lived nearby&#x2014;one wonders what desperation led them to settle in such gloomy spots&#x2014;might well have feared these creatures, whose panting breaths could be heard long before their deformed figures emerged from the mist. But such monsters were not cause for astonishment. People then would have regarded them as everyday hazards, and in those days there was so much else to worry about. How to get food out of the hard ground; how not to run out of firewood; how to stop the sickness that could kill a dozen pigs in a single day and produce green rashes on the cheeks of children.<br><br>In any case, ogres were not so bad provided one did not provoke them. One had to accept that every so often, perhaps following some obscure dispute in their ranks, a creature would come blundering into a village in a terrible rage, and despite shouts and brandishings of weapons, rampage about injuring anyone slow to move out of its path. Or that every so often, an ogre might carry off a child into the mist. The people of the day had to be philosophical about such outrages.<br><br>In one such area on the edge of a vast bog, in the shadow of some jagged hills, lived an elderly couple, Axl and Beatrice. Perhaps these were not their exact or full names, but for ease, this is how we will refer to them. I would say this couple lived an isolated life, but in those days few were &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; in any sense we would understand. For warmth and protection, the villagers lived in shelters, many of them dug deep into the hillside, connecting one to the other by underground passages and covered corridors. Our elderly couple lived within one such sprawling warren&#x2014;&#x201c;building&#x201d; would be too grand a word&#x2014;with roughly sixty other villagers. If you came out of their warren and walked for twenty minutes around the hill, you would have reached the next settlement, and to your eyes, this one would have seemed identical to the first. But to the inhabitants themselves, there would have been many distinguishing details of which they would have been proud or ashamed.<br><br>I have no wish to give the impression that this was all there was to the Britain of those days; that at a time when magnificent civilisations flourished elsewhere in the world, we were here not much beyond the Iron Age. Had you been able to roam the countryside at will, you might well have discovered castles containing music, fine food, athletic excellence; or monasteries with inhabitants steeped in learning. But there is no getting around it. Even on a strong horse, in good weather, you could have ridden for days without spotting any castle or monastery looming out of the greenery. Mostly you would have found communities like the one I have just described, and unless you had with you gifts of food or clothing, or were ferociously armed, you would not have been sure of a welcome. I am sorry to paint such a picture of our country at that time, but there you are.<br><br>To return to Axl and Beatrice. As I said, this elderly couple lived on the outer fringes of the warren, where their shelter was less protected from the elements and hardly benefited from the fire in the Great Chamber where everyone congregated at night. Perhaps there had been a time when they had lived closer to the fire; a time when they had lived with their children. In fact, it was just such an idea that would drift into Axl&#x2019;s mind as he lay in his bed during the empty hours before dawn, his wife soundly asleep beside him, and then a sense of some unnamed loss would gnaw at his heart, preventing him from returning to sleep.<br><br>Perhaps that was why, on this particular morning, Axl had abandoned his bed altogether and slipped quietly outside to sit on the old warped bench beside the entrance to the warren in wait for the first signs of daylight. It was spring, but the air still felt bitter, even with Beatrice&#x2019;s cloak, which he had taken on his way out and wrapped around himself. Yet he had become so absorbed in his thoughts that by the time he realised how cold he was, the stars had all but gone, a glow was spreading on the horizon, and the first notes of birdsong were emerging from the dimness.<br><br>He rose slowly to his feet, regretting having stayed out so long. He was in good health, but it had taken a while to shake off his last fever and he did not wish it to return. Now he could feel the damp in his legs, but as he turned to go back inside, he was well satisfied: for he had this morning succeeded in remembering a number of things that had eluded him for some time. Moreover, he now sensed he was about to come to some momentous decision&#x2014;one that had been put off far too long&#x2014;and felt an excitement within him which he was eager to share with his wife.<br><br>Inside, the passageways of the warren were still in complete darkness, and he was obliged to feel his way the short distance back to the door of his chamber. Many of the &#x201c;doorways&#x201d; within the warren were simple archways to mark the threshold to a chamber. The open nature of this arrangement would not have struck the villagers as compromising their privacy, but allowed rooms to benefit from any warmth coming down the corridors from the great fire or the smaller fires permitted within the warren. Axl and Beatrice&#x2019;s room, however, being too far from any fire had something we might recognise as an actual door; a large wooden frame criss-crossed with small branches, vines and thistles which someone going in and out would each time have to lift to one side, but which shut out the chilly draughts. Axl would happily have done without this door, but it had over time become an object of considerable pride to Beatrice. He had often returned to find his wife pulling off withered pieces from the construct and replacing them with fresh cuttings she had gathered during the day.<br><br>This morning, Axl moved the barrier just enough to let himself in, taking care to make as little noise as possible. Here, the early dawn light was leaking into the room through the small chinks of their outer wall. He could see his hand dimly before him, and on the turf bed, Beatrice&#x2019;s form still sound asleep under the thick blankets.<br><br>He was tempted to wake his wife. For a part of him felt sure that if, at this moment, she were awake and talking to him, whatever last barriers remained between him and his decision would finally crumble. But it was some time yet until the community roused itself and the day&#x2019;s work began, so he settled himself on the low stool in the corner of the chamber, his wife&#x2019;s cloak still tight around him.<br><br>He wondered how thick the mist would be that morning, and if, as the dark faded, he would see it had seeped through the cracks right into their chamber. But then his thoughts drifted away from such matters, back to what had been preoccupying him. Had they always lived like this, just the two of them, at the periphery of the community? Or had things once been quite different? Earlier, outside, some fragments of a remembrance had come back to him: a small moment when he was walking down the long central corridor of the warren, his arm around one of his own children, his gait a little crouched not on account of age as it might be now, but simply because he wished to avoid hitting his head on the beams in the murky light. Possibly the child had just been speaking to him, saying something amusing, and they were both of them laughing. But now, as earlier outside, nothing would quite settle in his mind, and the more he concentrated, the fainter the fragments seemed to grow. Perhaps these were just an elderly fool&#x2019;s imaginings. Perhaps it was that God had never given them children.<br><br>You may wonder why Axl did not turn to his fellow villa�gers for assistance in recalling the past, but this was not as easy as you might suppose. For in this community the past was rarely discussed. I do not mean that it was taboo. I mean that it had somehow faded into a mist as dense as that which hung over the marshes. It simply did not occur to these villagers to think about the past&#x2014;even the recent one.<br><br>To take an instance, one that had bothered Axl for some time: He was sure that not so long ago, there had been in their midst a woman with long red hair&#x2014;a woman regarded as crucial to their village. Whenever anyone injured themselves or fell sick, it had been this red-haired woman, so skilled at healing, who was immediately sent for. Yet now this same woman was no longer to be found anywhere, and no one seemed to wonder what had occurred, or even to express regret at her absence. When one morning Axl had mentioned the matter to three neighbours while working with them to break up the frosted field, their response told him that they genuinely had no idea what he was talking about. One of them had even paused in his work in an effort to remember, but had ended by shaking his head. &#x201c;Must have been a long time ago,&#x201d; he had said.</p><p>Excerpted from&nbsp;<b>THE BURIED GIANT&nbsp;</b>by Kazuo Ishiguro.

And this is a love story? Yup. 'Cept there's no whining. See, while some lovers were born to run, Jody and Tommy were born to bite. Well, reborn, that is, now that they're vampires. Good thing theirs is an undying love, since their Goth Girl Friday, Abby Normal, imprisoned them in a bronze statue.</p><p>Abby wants to be a bloodsucking fiend, too, but right now she's really busy with other stuff, like breaking in a pair of red vinyl thigh-high Skankenstein� platform boots and wrangling her Ph.D.-candidate boyfriend, Steve (the love monkey).

No longer must archaeologist Amelia Peabody and her husband, Emerson, the distinguished Egyptologist, fear for the life of their daring son, Ramses, now free from his dangerous wartime obligations to British Intelligence. The advent of a season of joy and peace marks a time of new beginnings in Luxor, with delightful additions to the growing Emerson family and fascinating wonders waiting to be discovered beneath the shifting Egyptian sands. </p><p>But in the aftermath of conflict, evil still casts a cold shadow over this violence-scarred land. The theft of valuable antiquities from the home of a friend causes great concern in the Emerson household. Ramses's strange encounter with a woman costumed in the veil and gold crown of a goddess only deepens the mystery. And the brutal death of the suspected thief washes the unsettling affair in blood. </p><p>Amelia's investigation sets her on a terrifying collision course with an adversary more fiendish and formidable than any she has ever encountered. And in her zeal to make things right, the indomitable Amelia may be feeding the flames of a devastating firestorm that threatens the fragile lives of the tender and the innocent. </p></p><p><p>Elizabeth Peters earned her Ph.D. in Egyptology from the University of Chicago&#x2019;s famed Oriental Institute. During her fifty-year career, she wrote more than seventy novels and three nonfiction books on Egypt. She received numerous writing awards and, in 2012, was given the first Amelia Peabody Award, created in her honor. She died in 2013, leaving a partially completed manuscript of <em>The Painted Queen</em>. </p>A fast-moving, intrigue-filled plot propels MWA Grand Master Peters's 15th novel (after 2002's The Golden One) to feature beloved archeologist and amateur sleuth Amelia Peabody Emerson. The end of WWI offers Amelia, now a grandmother, and her family little respite when mysterious events start to plague friends, allies and coworkers. One person dies after suddenly turning to religion, while others fall victim to sabotage. Valuable artifacts go missing, and Amelia's son Ramses is lured into a bizarre encounter with a woman who appears to be the living embodiment of the goddess Hathor. Given the growing unrest against British rule in Egypt, Amelia has to wonder if politics are behind the strange occurrences. In addition, the clan has made many enemies over the course of their adventures. While the preface does a good job of outlining the characters and their complicated connections, the previous 14 novels covered a lot of ground that new readers will find challenging to master. Nonetheless, this is an enjoyable read in its own right, powered by evocative depictions of 1919 Egypt and the engaging voice of Amelia herself-a bright, independent woman, who relishes her role as family matriarch. Her affectionate, give-and-take relationship with her Egyptologist husband, Emerson, continues to enchant.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Tale Of Despereaux - Being The Story Of A Mouse, A Princess, Some Soup, And A Spool Of Thread</h2><p>This is a beautifully written story!</p><p></p><h2>The Critique of Pure Reason (Great Books in Philosophy)</h2><p>Metaphysicians have for centuries attempted to clarify the nature of the world and how rational human beings construct their ideas of it. Materialists believed that the world (including its human component) consisted of objective matter, an irreducible substance to which qualities and characteristics could be attributed. Mindthoughts, ideas, and perceptionswas viewed as a more sophisticated material substance. Idealists, on the other hand, argued that the world acquired its reality from mind, which breathed metaphysical life into substances that had no independent existence of their own.These two camps seemed deadlocked until Immanuel Kant&#39;s Critique of Pure Reason endeavored to show that the most accurate theory of reality would be one that combined relevant aspects of each position, yet transcended both to arrive at a more fundamental metaphysical theory. Kant&#39;s synthesis sought to disclose how human reason goes about constructing its experience of the world, thus intertwining objective simuli with rational processes that arrive at an orderly view of nature.</p><p>This entirely new translation of Critique of Pure Reason is the most accurate and informative English translation ever produced of this epochal philosophical text. Though its simple, direct style will make it suitable for all new readers of Kant, the translation displays a philosophical and textual sophistication that will enlighten Kant scholars as well. This translation recreates as far as possible a text with the same interpretative nuances and richness as the original.Kessinger Publishing reprints over 1,500 similar titles all available through Amazon.com.</p><h2>Nobody Walks</h2><p><b>Set in the same fictional London as his CWA Gold Dagger Award-winning Slough House spy series, Mick Herron now introduces Tom Bettany, a man with a violent past and only one thing to live for: Avenging his son&#x2019;s death.</b><br><br> Tom Bettany is working at a meat processing plant in France when he gets a voicemail from an Englishwoman he doesn&#x2019;t know telling him that his estranged 26-year-old son is dead&#x2014;Liam Bettany fell from his London balcony, where he was smoking pot.<br><br>Now for the first time since he cut all ties years ago, Bettany returns home to London&nbsp;to find out the truth about his son&#x2019;s death.

And there it lingered like a moth in a box, weightless, and aching for the light.<br>&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br>The street cleaners&#x2019; lorry woke Bettany. It was 4:25 am. He washed at the sink, dressed, turned the bed&#x2019;s thin mattress, and rolled his sleeping bag into a tight package he leaned upright in a corner. 4:32.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locking the door was an act of faith or satire&#x2014;the lock would barely withstand a rattle&#x2014;but the room wouldn&#x2019;t be empty long, because someone else used it during the day. Bettany hadn&#x2019;t met him, but they&#x2019;d reached an accommodation. The daytime occupant respected Bettany&#x2019;s possessions&#x2014;his toothbrush, his sleeping bag, the dog-eared copy of <i>Dubliners</i> he&#x2019;d found on a bus&#x2014;and in return Bettany left untouched the clothing that hung from a hook on the door, three shirts and a pair of khakis.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His own spare clothing he kept in a duffel bag in a locker at the sheds. Passport and wallet he carried in a security belt with his mobile, until that got lost or stolen.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside was February cold, quiet enough that he could hear water rinsing the sewers. A bus grumbled past, windows fogged. Bettany nodded to the whore on the corner, whose territory was bounded by two streetlights. She was Senegalese, pre-op, currently a redhead, and he&#x2019;d bought her a drink one night, God knew why. They had exile in common, but little else. Bettany&#x2019;s French remained undistinguished, and the hooker&#x2019;s English didn&#x2019;t lend itself to small talk.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A taste of the sea hung in the air. This would burn off later, and be replaced by urban flavours.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He caught the next bus, a twenty-minute ride to the top of a lane which fell from the main road like an afterthought, and as he trudged downhill a truck passed, horn blaring, its headlights yellowing the sheds ahead, which were barn-sized constructions behind wire-topped fences. A wooden sign hung lopsided from the gates, one of its tethering chains longer than the other. The words were faded by weather. Bettany had never been able to make them out.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Audible now, the sound of cattle in distress.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was waved through and fetched his apron from the locker room. A group of men were smoking by the door, and one grunted his name.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Tonton.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What they called him, for reasons lost in the mist of months.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He knotted his apron, which was stained so thick with blood and grease it felt plastic, and fumbled his gloves on.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out in the yard the truck was impatient, its exhaust fumes spoiling out in thick black ropes. The noise from the nearest shed was mechanical, mostly, and its smells metallic and full of fear. Behind Bettany men stamped their cigarettes out and hawked noisily. Refrigerated air whispered from the truck&#x2019;s dropped tailgate.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bettany&#x2019;s role wasn&#x2019;t complicated. Lorries arrived bearing cattle and the cattle were fed into the sheds. What came out was meat, which was then ferried away in different lorries. Bettany&#x2019;s job, and that of his companions, was to carry the meat to the lorries. This not only required no thought, it demanded thought&#x2019;s absence. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At day&#x2019;s end he&#x2019;d hose down the yard, a task he performed with grim diligence, meticulously blasting every scrap of matter down the drains.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He switched off, and the working day took over. This was measured in a familiar series of aches and smells and sounds, the same actions repeated with minor variations, while blurred memories nagged him uninvited, moments which had seemed unexceptional at the time, but had persisted. A woman in a caf�, regarding him with what might have been interest, might have been contempt. An evening at the track with Majeed, who was the nearest he&#x2019;d made to a friend, though he hadn&#x2019;t made enemies. He didn&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;d made enemies.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thoughts became rituals in themselves. You plodded the same course over and over, like any dumb beast or wind-up toy.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At about the time citizens would be leaving their homes in clean shirts Bettany stopped for coffee, pitch black in a polystyrene cup. He ate a hunk of bread wrapped round cheese, leaning against the fence and watching grey weather arrive, heading inland. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From three metres&#x2019; distance Majeed detached himself from a group similarly occupied.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hey, Tonton. You lose your mobile?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It spun through the air. He caught it one-handed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>Ou?</i>&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>La Girondelle</i>.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bar at the track. He was surprised to see it again, though the reason why wasn&#x2019;t long in coming.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>C&#x2019;est de la merde</i>. Not worth stealing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bettany gave no argument.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The piece of shit, not worth stealing, was barely worth ringing either, though still had a flicker of charge. Four missed calls in nine days. Two were local numbers and hadn&#x2019;t left messages. The others were from England, unfamiliar streams of digits. Odds were they were cold calls, checking out his inclinations vis-�-vis internet banking or double-glazing. He finished his coffee undecided whether to listen or delete, then found his thumb resolving the issue of its own accord, scrolling to his voicemail number, pressing play.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, this is Detective Sergeant Welles, speaking from Hoxton police station. Er, London. I&#x2019;m trying to reach a Mr. Thomas Bettany? If you could give me a ring at your earliest convenience. It&#x2019;s a matter of some importance.&#x201d; He recited a number slowly enough that Bettany caught it first time.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His mouth was dry. The bread, the cheese, grew lumpy in his stomach.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second voice was less measured.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Mr. Bettany? Liam&#x2019;s father?&#x201d; It was a girl, or young woman. &#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Flea, Felicity Pointer? I&#x2019;m calling about Liam . . . Mr. Bettany, I&#x2019;m so sorry to have to tell you this.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sounded sorry.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There&#x2019;s been an accident. Liam&#x2014;I&#x2019;m sorry, Mr. Bettany. Liam died.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Either she paused a long while or the recorded silence dragged itself out in slow motion, eating up his pre-paid minutes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Message ends. To hear the message envelope, press One. To save the&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He killed the robot voice.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearby, Majeed was halfway through a story, dropping into English when French wasn&#x2019;t obscene enough. Bettany could hear the creaking of a trolley&#x2019;s metal wheels, a chain scraping over a beam. Another lorry trundled down the lane, its grille broad, an American model. Already details were stacking up. More blurred snapshots he&#x2019;d flick through in future days, always associated with the news just heard.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He reached for the back of his neck, and untied his apron.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Tonton?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He dropped it to the ground.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>Ou vas-tu?</i>&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bettany fetched his duffel from the locker.<br> <b><br><br> </b> <b>1.2</b><br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;The crematorium was single-storey, stucco-clad, with a high chimney. On one side creeping plants swarmed a cane trellis that bordered an array of small gardens divided by hedges. Japanese stones neighboured ornamental ponds and bonsaid trees peered from terracotta pots. Other patches echoed formal English styles, orchards, terraced rosebeds, in any of which you might strew the ashes of the departed, supposing the deceased had expressed a preference.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bettany imagined Liam saying <i>When I&#x2019;m dead, scatter me on a Japanese garden. Not in actual Japan. Just anywhere handy</i>.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A mild English winter was turning chill, but all that remained of the morning&#x2019;s frost was a damp smudge on the pavements. The imprints of vanished leaves were stamped there too, like the work of a graffiti artist who&#x2019;d run out of things to say.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bettany&#x2019;s once-blond shaggy hair was now streaked grey, like his ragged beard, and while his eyes were strikingly blue, their expression was vague. His hands, large and raw, were jammed in the pockets of a cheap raincoat, and he rocked slightly on feet cased in work-boots that had seen better days. Under the coat he wore jeans, a long-sleeved crew-neck tee and a zippered top. These were the spare clothes from his duffel bag, but three days&#x2019; wear had taken their toll. The duffel itself he&#x2019;d abandoned in a bin, he couldn&#x2019;t remember which side of the Channel. For all the hours he&#x2019;d spent on buses, he&#x2019;d managed little sleep. His only conversation had been a brief exchange on the ferry, when a French trucker lent him the use of a phone charger.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His first stop on reaching London had been Hoxton Police Station.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Detective Sergeant Welles, once located, had been sympathetic.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry for your loss.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bettany nodded.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nobody seemed to know where you were. But there was an idea you were out of the country. I&#x2019;m glad you got back in time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which was how he discovered the cremation was taking place that morning.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#x2019;d sat in the back row. The chapel of remembrance was quarter-full, most of the congregation Liam&#x2019;s age, none of them known to him, but an introduction contained a familiar name, Felicity Pointer. Flea, she&#x2019;d called herself on the phone. She approached the lectern looking twenty-five, twenty-six, brunette and lightly olive-skinned, wearing black of course. Hardly looking at the assembled company, she read a short poem about chimney sweeps, then returned to her seat.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Watching this, Bettany had barely paid attention to the main object of interest, but looking at it now he realised that what he&#x2019;d been feeling these past three days was not grief but numbness. A pair of curtains provided the backdrop, and behind them the coffin would soon pass, and there the remains of his only son would be reduced to ash and fragments of bone, to the mess of clinker you&#x2019;d find in a grate on a winter&#x2019;s morning. Nothing of substance. And all Bettany could make of it was an all-consuming absence of feeling, as if he was indeed the stranger his son had made of him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He rose and slipped out of the door.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting by the trellis, it struck him that it was seven years since he&#x2019;d been in London. He supposed he ought to be noticing differences, things being better or worse, but he couldn&#x2019;t see much had changed. The skyline had altered, with new towers jutting heavenwards from the City, and more poised to sprout everywhere you looked. But that had always been the case. London had never been finished, and never would be. Or not by dint of new construction.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seven years since London, three of them in Lyme. Then Hannah had died, and he&#x2019;d left England. Now Liam had died, and he was back.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welles had given him a lift here. There might have been a hidden agenda, pump the father for information, but Bettany had none to offer and the flow had gone the other way. How it had happened, for instance. Up through France, across the choppy Channel, Bettany hadn&#x2019;t known the how. Of the various possibilities some kind of traffic accident had seemed most likely, Liam driving too fast on a fog-bound stretch of motorway, or a bus mounting the pavement, Liam in the wrong place. He could have called and spared himself conjecture, but that would have been to make imagination fact. Now he learned that there had been no cars involved, no buses. Liam had fallen from the window of his flat.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Were you in close contact with your son, Mr. Bettany?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So you wouldn&#x2019;t know much about his lifestyle?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even know where he lived.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not far from here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which would make it N1.

That's the tag line of Brad Meltzer's new thriller, which pits an ambitious young money manager against a corporate villain, whose intricate financial shenanigans accidentally put a huge chunk of dough right in front of a man who desperately needs it. Of course Oliver Caruso's conscience troubles him, but that doesn't keep him from letting his somewhat looser and less ethical brother convince him this is too good an opportunity to pass up. Meltzer's in interesting territory here, but in order to buy his premise, you have to believe that it's OK to steal if you have a good enough reason. This makes his protagonist, who narrates the novel, hard to root for and less than sympathetic. Despite this hollow ring, the book is nicely plotted and should please the author's enthusiastic fan club. <i>--Jane Adams</i>BRAD MELTZER is the author of the New York Times bestsellers The Tenth Justice, Dead Even, and The First Counsel.

He dropped to his knees, howling in agony while a nearby coyote, startled by the sound, responded with a howl of its own. Rigid with pain, at first he couldn't even reach for the door handle. By the time he did, it was too late. The door lock inside the vehicle had already clicked home. </p><p> "Please," he begged. "For God's sake, open the door." </p><p> But the answer to that was no -- an unequivocal no. The engine turned over and the car began to move. </p><p> "You can't do this," he screamed. "You can't!" </p><p> By then the pavement was moving beneath him, slowly at first, then faster and faster. He held out his other hand, trying to brace himself or somehow pull himself back to his feet. For a moment that almost worked and he was close to upright, but then the speed of the car outdistanced his scrambling feet and he fell again, facedown this time, with the full weight of his body pulling on the exploding pain in his fingers. </p><p> As the speed of the vehicle increased, so did his agonized screams. The parking lot's layer of loose gravel scraped and tore at him, shredding his blue-and-white jogging suit; shredding his skin. By the time the hurtling car bounced over the first speed bump, he was no longer screaming. Plowing face-first into the second one momentarily knocked him unconscious. </p><p> He came to when the car door opened. Once his trapped hand was released from the door frame, he fell to the ground. He couldn't actually see the car or even the ground for that matter. He seemed to have been struck blind. Nor could he differentiate the pain in his crippled hand from the agony in the rest of his tortured body, but his ears still worked. He heard the car door slam shut again and felt the spray of gravel from the tires as it drove away into the night, leaving him in absolute darkness. </p><p> He lay there for a long time, knowing he was barely alive and feeling his life's blood seeping out through layers of damaged skin. He tried crawling, but he couldn't make that work. </p><p> "Help," he called weakly. "Somebody, please help me." </p><p> In the wilds of Phoenix's South Mountain Preserve, only a single prowling coyote heard the dying man's final whispered plea for help. The coyote was on the trail of his dinner -- an elusive bunny -- and he paid no attention. </p><p> No one else did, either. <b></b></p><p><b> * * * </b> </p><p> Sybil Harriman strode through the early morning chill and reveled in the sunlight and the clear crisp air. Across the valley, she could see the layer of smog settling in over the rest of the city, but here it was cold and clear -- cold enough to see her breath and make her nose run and her eyes water, but not cold enough to scare her away from walking the full course of the park's Alta Trail and back to the parking lot along the Bajada. </p><p> She had been warned that Alta was "too difficult" for someone her age, and that she certainly shouldn't walk it alone. So she did so, at least twice a week. Because she could. And as she walked along, huffing and puffing a little, truth be known, she was also drinking in the view and the cactus and the birds -- birds so different from the ones she'd grown up with back in Chicago -- and she was also thinking about how wrong she'd been and wishing things had been different. </p><p> Herman had wanted to move here the moment he retired from working for Merck. She was the one who had fought it, saying they should stay where they were in order to be closer to the kids and grandkids, although a lot of good that had done. Finally, when Herm's arthritis had gotten so bad that he could barely walk, she had relented. Now she was sorry they hadn't come sooner, while Herman would have been able to reap some of the benefits of desert living. </p><p> His arthritis had improved so much once they were in Arizona it was unbelievable, but then the rest of it had happened. The dry climate could do nothing at all to stave off the ravages and gradual decline that was Alzheimer's. As for the kids? Once Herm died, it had been plain enough that what they wanted more than anything was to get their greedy little hands on their father's money. Well, thanks to the trust Herm had wisely insisted on setting up, they weren't getting any of that, not until Sybil was damned good and ready. And that was another reason she walked every single day. She was determined to live as long and as well as she could. </p><p> <i>Let 'em wait,</i> she told herself fiercely as she marched along. <i>They can wait until hell freezes over.</i> </p><p> When she returned to Chicago for Herm's funeral, her friends there hardly recognized her. They thought she had dropped the </p><p> excess weight she had carried all those years in a fit of sudden grief. In actual fact, the process had been much less abrupt than that -- and much more permanent. She had started by walking four miles each day on the flat but circular streets in their Awatukee neighborhood. Later she had forced herself up and down the steeper grades and gradually more and more difficult trails throughout South Mountain Preserve. </p><p> Sybil was one of the early birds this crisp January morning. She had seen not a soul on her morning walk -- at least no other humans -- in the course of her almost three solitary hours. There had been plenty of bunnies, however, and scads of other early birds -- doves, quail, skittish roadrunners, breakfasting cactus wrens, finches, colorful hummingbirds, hawks, and even an ebony-feathered, red-eyed phainopepla. Now, as she approached the spot where the trail crossed San Juan Road, it was close to midmorning and the sun was high. </p><p> San Juan Road had been closed indefinitely for some strange reason, so there shouldn't have been any traffic. Still, Sybil was too much of a city girl to cross a road or a street without looking both ways. And that's when she saw it -- what appeared to be a pile of rags or trash lying in the middle of the roadway some thirty or forty yards northeast of the now abandoned San Juan parking lot. </p><p> Offended that someone would toss out a load of garbage and leave it there in the road, Sybil headed in that direction. She was determined to clean up the mess and haul it off to the nearest garbage containers. Ten yards or so away from the debris field, however, she saw the blood. </p><p> With a trembling hand, she pulled out her cell phone and dialed 911. "Emergency operator. What are you reporting?" </p><p> Sybil was closer to the mess now -- much too close -- and wished she wasn't. There was blood everywhere. It was hard to tell that the flayed and bloody pulp inside the pile of shredded clothing was even human, but she knew it was. </p><p> "A body," she managed at last. "I've just found a human body lying here in the middle of the road." </p><p> She didn't hear the panic in her voice, but the operator evidently did. "Calm down," the operator advised her. "What is your name and your location?" </p><p> Sybil took a deep breath and forced herself to get a grip. "Sybil Harriman," she replied. "I'm in the park -- South Mountain Preserve. The body is just to the east of the abandoned parking lot on San Juan Road." </p><p> "Units are on the way," the operator told her briskly. "Are you sure the person is dead? Did you check for a pulse?" </p><p> Sybil looked at the mound of bloody flesh, searching for wrists. One hand, virtually skinless, was little more than a bloody stump. The other hand contained a relatively recognizable thumb, but the four fingers seemed to have been mashed flat. Sybil knew at once there would be no pulse in either one of those two mangled wrists nor would there be any possibility of bringing the bloodied victim back to life. </p><p> "He's dead," she whispered to the operator. "Sorry. I've got to hang up now." </p><p> Sybil snapped the phone shut. Then, gagging, she staggered over to the edge of the road and promptly lost the single banana she had eaten for breakfast. </p><p> As she straightened up and waited, listening for approaching sirens, Sybil Harriman knew it was the last banana she would eat for a very long time. </p><p> Copyright � 2007 by J.A. Jance </p><p><b></b></p><p><b> Chapter One </b> </p><p> With her laptop asleep and perched virtually untouched on her crossed legs, Ali Reynolds stared into the flames of the burning gas log fireplace. She was supposed to be working on her blog, cutlooseblog.com, but on this chilly January morning she wasn't. Or maybe she was. She was trying to think of what to say in today's post, but her mind remained stubbornly blank -- right along with her computer screen. </p><p> Ali had started cutloose in the aftermath of the sudden and almost simultaneous ends of both her television newscasting career and her marriage. Back then, fueled by anger, cutloose had been a tool for dealing with the unexpected bumps in her own life. To her surprise, what had happened to her was far more commonplace than she had known, and what she had written in cutloose had touched chords in the lives of countless other women. </p><p> Since the murder of Paul Grayson, Ali's not quite, but nearly ex-husband, cutloose had morphed into something else entirely. For weeks now it had focused on grief and grieving -- on the pitfalls and setbacks that lie in wait for those attempting to recover from the loss of a loved one or even a not-so-loved one. Ali had learned enough from her readers that she could almost have declared herself an expert on the subject if it hadn't been for the inconvenient reality that she had zero perspective on the topic. She was still too deep in grief herself. As her mother, Edie Larson, would have said, drawing on her endless supply of platitudes: She couldn't see the forest for the trees. </p><p> Because Ali was back in her hometown of Sedona, Arizona, grieving. She grieved for a phantom of a marriage that had evidently never been what she had thought it was and for a job she had loved but which had come with zero job security and no reciprocal loyalty. </p><p> Having people write to her and tell her that "someday you'll be over it" or "it doesn't matter how ...</p></p><h2>No Compromise: The Life Story of Keith Green</h2><p>Now you can experience the impact of Keith Green&#39;s life, courage, and commitment to holiness.

Few westerners had experienced manga (Japanese comics) before Akira, and its rocketing ascent through cultural divides helped impress a cynical world that had long been convinced that pictures in books should be relegated to children&#39;s stories. Now pictures were being used to tell one of man&#39;s most explosive and harrowing tales. Since his groundbreaking work on Akira, Mr. Otomo has completed a number of inspired manga classics, including the powerful post-apocalyptic Legend of Mother Sarah and the dark study of a child&#39;s dreams, Domu. Otomo&#39;s mastery of the manga artform was recognized with a top Japanese book award, the Grand Prix, awarded to him in honor of Domu in 1989.

She begins each day with a long list. &#x201c;Keep the house picked up; limit myself to two Diet Cokes; spend special time with each of the kids; work out; pray; avoid sugar; read a chapter in a book about something very important; read my Bible; call my mom.&#x201d; She determines each day&#x2019;s worth, and ultimately her own, by keeping track of her stats&#x2015;pounds gained or lost, stuff accomplished. <br><br>That is, until God spoke into her life, waking her up to the true costs of her addiction to perfection. <i>Confessions of a Raging Perfectionist</i> is more than Amanda&#x2019;s confession; it&#x2019;s a journey of letting go of the subtle but destructive idols of her overactive inner voice and replacing them with God&#x2019;s truth. Amanda hopes her journey can inspire others to let God dig in to their own lives, uncovering the subtle lies we unconsciously live by.</p><p><i>Minutes I spent working out: 45<br>Minutes I spent reading my Bible: 10<br>Number of kids who got my undivided attention: 2 outta 4<br>Number of rooms looking picture perfect: 2�<br>Number of Diet Cokes I drank to power through: 4<br></i><br><br>Eesh&#x2015;room for improvement.

Fassin Taak, a Slow Seer at the Court of the Nasqueron Dwellers, will be fortunate if he makes it to the end of the year.</p><p>The Nasqueron Dwellers inhabit a gas giant on the outskirts of the galaxy, in a system awaiting its wormhole connection to the rest of civilisation. In the meantime, they are dismissed as decadents living in a state of highly developed barbarism, hoarding data without order, hunting their own young and fighting pointless formal wars.</p><p>Seconded to a military-religious order he's barely heard of - part of the baroque hierarchy of the Mercatoria, the latest galactic hegemony - Fassin Taak has to travel again amongst the Dwellers. He is in search of a secret hidden for half a billion years. But with each day that passes a war draws closer - a war that threatens to overwhelm everything and everyone he's ever known.</p><p>As complex, turbulent, flamboyant and spectacular as the gas giant on which it is set, the new science fiction novel from Iain M. Banks is space opera on a truly epic scale.</p></p><p>In <i>The Algebraist</i>, Iain Banks returns to spectacular space opera but not to his familiar Culture universe. His new setting is a complex, war-torn galaxy with an entirely different history going back almost to the Big Bang...<p> For short-lived 'Quick' races like humans, space is dominated by the complicated, grandiose Mercatoria whose rule is both military and religious. To the Dwellers who may live billions of years, the galaxy consists of their gas-giant planets--the rest is debris.</p><p> Our human hero Fassin Taak is a 'Slow Seer' privileged to work with the Dwellers of the gas-giant Nasqueron in his home system Ulubis. His life work is rummaging for data in their vast, disorganised memories and libraries. Unfortunately, without knowing it, he's come close to an ancient secret of unimaginable importance.</p><p> Though Ulubis is currently cut off from the galactic wormhole travel network, two interstellar battle fleets are racing for this secret. The hissable arch-villain Luseferous--whose tastes run to torture, atrocity and genocide--seems bound to arrive in overwhelming strength before the Mercatorian rescue squadron.</p><p> So Fassin is reluctantly conscripted into security forces, and enters the hell of Nasqueron's atmosphere to seek the magic key (code? signal frequency? equation?) that might save everything. Even at their most helpful and charming, though, Dwellers are maddeningly elusive. For ancients, they seem bumbling and whimsical, far more interested in hunting, kudos, and extreme sports like GasClipper Races or Formal War than in saving humanity's skin. Their ramshackle transport and awesome yet run-down floating cities suggest that Dweller legends of hypertechnology are sheer bluff. But are they keeping something dark?</p><p> Fassin's journeys and discoveries are exhilarating, witty, sometimes mind-boggling. Exotic weaponry abounds. The Dwellers are engagingly eccentric, like AI Minds in the Culture books--but the Mercatoria has banned artificial intelligence as Abomination, and this too is a plot strand. Additionally there are human revenge, intrigue and betrayal subplots; surprises and upsets; and the mother of all shaggy-dog revelations. Once again Banks is having enormous fun with space opera, and his exuberant enjoyment is infectious.

Two hundred years after the trials in Salem, Adelaide Thom (Moth from <i>The Virgin Cure</i>) has left her life in the sideshow to open a tea shop with another young woman who feels it's finally safe enough to describe herself as a witch: a former medical student and <i>gardien de sorts</i> (keeper of spells), Eleanor St. Clair. Together they cater to Manhattan's high society ladies, specializing in cures, palmistry and potions--and in guarding the secrets of their clients. All is well until one bright September afternoon, when an enchanting young woman named Beatrice Dunn arrives at their door seeking employment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beatrice soon becomes indispensable as Eleanor's apprentice, but her new life with the witches is marred by strange occurrences. She sees things no one else can see. She hears voices no one else can hear. Objects appear out of thin air, as if gifts from the dead. Has she been touched by magic or is she simply losing her mind? Eleanor wants to tread lightly and respect the magic manifest in the girl, but Adelaide sees a business opportunity. Working with Dr. Quinn Brody, a talented alienist, she submits Beatrice to a series of tests to see if she truly can talk to spirits. Amidst the witches' tug-of-war over what's best for her, Beatrice disappears, leaving them to wonder whether it was by choice or by force. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Adelaide and Eleanor begin the desperate search for Beatrice, they're confronted by accusations and spectres from their own pasts. In a time when women were corseted, confined and committed for merely speaking their minds, were any of them safe?</p><p>AMI McKAY's debut novel, <i>The Birth House</i>, was a #1 bestseller in Canada, winner of three CBA Libris Awards, nominated for the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, a finalist for Canada Reads and a book-club favourite around the world.

The author lives in Scots Bay, Nova Scotia.<b><i>City of Wonders.<br></i></b><br> In the dusky haze of evening a ruddy-cheeked newsboy strode along Fifth Avenue proclaiming the future. &#x201c;The great Egyptian obelisk is about to land on our shores! The Brooklyn Bridge set to become the Eighth Wonder of the World! Broadway soon to glow with electric light!&#x201d; In his wake, a crippled man shuffled, spouting prophecies of his own. &#x201c;God&#x2019;s judgement is upon us! The end of the world is nigh!&#x201d; <br><br> New York had become a city of astonishments. Wonders and marvels came so frequent and fast, a day without spec�tacle was cause for concern.<br><br> Men involved themselves with the business of making mir�acles. Men in starched collars and suits, men in wool caps and dirty boots. From courtrooms to boardrooms to the news�rooms of Park Row; from dockyards to scaffolds to Mr. Roebling&#x2019;s Great Bridge&#x2014;every man to a one had a head full of schemes: to erect a monument to genius, to become a wizard of invention, to discover the unknown. They set their sights on greatness while setting their watches to the drop of the Western Union Time Ball. Their dreams no longer came to them via stardust and angel&#x2019;s wings, but by tug, train and telegraph. Sleep lost all meaning now that Time was in man&#x2019;s grasp. <br><br> In the building beneath the tower that held the time ball, a mindful order of women sat&#x2014;side by side, row on row, storey upon storey, one hundred young ladies in all, working round the clock to translate the wishes of men to dots and dashes. Transfixed by the steady <i>click-clack </i>of their task, the ghost of Mr. Samuel Morse hovered near. He&#x2019;d tried to get to Heaven on numerous occasions, but could never seem to find his way past the tangled canopy of telegraph lines that criss-crossed the skies above Manhattan. What he needed was an angel, or better yet, a witch. Someone to translate the knocks and rappings of his soul, to convey all the things he&#x2019;d left unsaid. Where could one be found? Were there any left?<br><br> In a halo of lamplight near the Western Union Building, a prostitute leaned her aching back against the bricks. Lips rouged, eyes rimmed with charcoal, she was waiting for a man. Puffing on a cigarette she&#x2019;d begged off a stranger, she blew a steady stream of smoke rings in the air. At the edge of her sight, a shadowy figure in the shape of a fine-dressed gentleman appeared&#x2014;five feet off the ground, coattails flapping in the breeze. Rubbing her eyes, the girl shook her head, thinking she&#x2019;d had too much to drink. She swore, hand to God, she&#x2019;d get off the booze one day, not now, of course, maybe in the spring. <br><br> As the ghost dissolved from her view, the girl flicked the stub of her cigarette to the ground and crushed it with the heel of her boot. Hand in her pocket she reached for a trinket she&#x2019;d been given by her last john. &#x201c;A lucky rabbit&#x2019;s foot,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said, &#x201c;blessed by a bona fide witch.&#x201d; &#x201c;Liar,&#x201d; the girl had com�plained when he&#x2019;d offered her the charm along with half of what he was supposed to pay. &#x201c;No, no, no,&#x201d; the john had insisted. &#x201c;I tell you, she was <i>real </i>. . . a real witch with a very fine ass.&#x201d; With that, the girl had grabbed the trinket and sent the john on his way. Something was better than nothing. She needed all the help she could get. <br><br> Stroking the soft fur of the rabbit&#x2019;s foot, the girl thought of all she lacked. She was tired, she needed sleep, but she wanted more booze. When she glanced at the spot where she&#x2019;d snuffed out the butt, there was a shiny new dime in its place. Picking the coin off the ground, she wondered if maybe the john had been right after all. Maybe the damn foot was lucky. Maybe the witch was real. Maybe her luck had changed because the john had dipped his willy in a witch and then dipped it in her, leaving behind some strange magic. There were worse things she could catch, she guessed.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> In the shadow of the Great Bridge, a young widow knelt to plead with the river. Just after supper she&#x2019;d spied something terrible in the soapy murk of her dishwater, a vision she&#x2019;d seen once before, and she&#x2019;d just as soon forget. Each time she closed her eyes, it came to her again&#x2014;a man&#x2019;s face, bloated and blue, gasping for air. The last time she&#x2019;d seen it, it&#x2019;d been her husband&#x2019;s. This time it was a stranger&#x2019;s. <br><br> &#x201c;I understand,&#x201d; the woman said to the river, touching the surface of the water with a finger. &#x201c;I know how it feels to be slighted.&#x201d; She also understood that the river required pay�ment from those who wished to cross it. Blood, flesh and bone were what it liked best. The widow didn&#x2019;t have much of anything to give as an offering&#x2014;a few pennies, a splash of whiskey, the cheerful tune of an ancient song&#x2014;but she hoped that if she were gentle, persuasive and kind, the river might change its mind. Was it witchcraft she was plying? She didn&#x2019;t care so long as it worked. Something had to be done. Something was better than nothing.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>In the cellar of a modest house on the edge of the Tenderloin, a weary housekeeper lit a candle and said a prayer. Taper in one hand, glass jar in the other, she poured wax around the edge of the jar&#x2019;s lid to seal it shut. The jar&#x2014;filled with stale urine, old needles, shards of mirror, brass buttons, bent nails and thirteen drops of blood from her left thumb&#x2014;was what her wise grandmother had called a &#x201c;witch&#x2019;s bottle.&#x201d; While others might call it humbug, the housekeeper saw the jar and its contents as her last hope to dispel the strange darkness that&#x2019;d settled in her midst. What else could explain all that&#x2019;d happened since the master of the house had passed? For weeks she&#x2019;d been plagued by what she thought was a ghost or, perhaps, a demon, lurking in her room, stealing her sight, shaking her bed, night after night. What did it want? Where had it come from? Why wouldn&#x2019;t it leave her alone? Prayers, hymns and a desperate stint of almsgiving hadn&#x2019;t driven it away. She feared the terrible thing wouldn&#x2019;t rest until it saw her dead. Had she been cursed? Something had to be done. As her grandmother would say, <i>Wo gibt es Hexen, gibt es Geister. </i>Where there are witches there are ghosts. <br> &nbsp;<br> In a quiet corner of a cozy teashop just shy of Madison Square Park, a magnificent raven sat on a perch, preening its feathers. As the bird tugged and fussed at its wing, three women con�versed around a nearby table&#x2014;one, a lady of considerable wealth, the others a pair of witches, keepers of the bird and the shop. &#x201c;Can you help?&#x201d; the lady inquired, worry catching in her throat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m at my wit&#x2019;s end. Something must be done.&#x201d; <br><br> One witch answered with a confident, &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; <br> The other humbly replied, &#x201c;Leave it with us.&#x201d; <br><br>The raven cast an indifferent eye upon them. He&#x2019;d wit�nessed this sort of thing before&#x2014;the woman, unable to manage her affairs, needed a witch (or two) to make things right. That was all fine and good, but he was more interested in a faint sound coming from overhead, an enchanting jangle akin to when prisms on a chandelier touch. But how could that be when there was no chandelier to be found in the shop? He was certain unexpected magic was afoot. <br> Tea was poured, complaints and concerns heard, sympa�thy given. Crystal ball and grimoire consulted. Palms and tea leaves read. How pleased the bird was when he noticed the tray of teacakes in the centre of the table had barely been touched. How pleased the lady was when the witches pre�sented her with a small package tied with red string. <br> The lady was sure she felt something move within the parcel. A tiny tremor of mystical vibration, perhaps? A sign of things to come? She&#x2019;d heard rumours from a friend of a friend that these women could work miracles. She prayed it was true. She wanted to believe. Lowering her voice, she said, &#x201c;You swear this thing has been touched by witchcraft?&#x201d; <br><br> One of the women gave a polite nod and said, &#x201c;Of course, my dear, of course.&#x201d;<br> The other replied with a smile and a shrug. &#x201c;Call it what you like.&#x201d; <br> The raven simply cocked its head. It was all he could do not to laugh.</p><h2>Pearls Freaks the #*%# Out: A (Freaky) Pearls Before Swine Treasury (Volume 18)</h2><p>An author-annotated <i>Pearls Before Swine</i> treasury featuring cartoons from <i>Larry in Wonderland </i>and <i>Because Sometimes You Just Have to Draw a Cover with Your Left Hand.</i><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>From fire-breathing jugglers to sword-swallowing illusionists, this treasury showcases all strips from <i>Larry in Wonderland</i> and <i>Because Sometimes You Just Gotta Draw a Cover with Your Left Hand</i>, along with Pastis's original commentary, which provides insight into what Pastis was thinking at the time random strips were conceived, and also fan reactions.<br><br>Tackling topics ranging from current events and modern technology to human and croc nature, <i>Pearls Freaks the #*%# Out</i> offers up a sideshow of feisty characters, including arrogant, self-centered, and totally hilarious Rat, who leads his four-legged collection of freakish friends through a carnival of misadventure. Joining the circuslike cavalcade are Pig, the slow but good-hearted conscience of the strip; Goat, the voice of reason that often goes unheard; Zebra, the activist; and those eternally inept carnivorous Crocs, who we learn happen to taste a lot like chicken.

Pastis lives in the Bay Area with his wife and two children.</p><h2>Ice Hunt</h2><p>Carved into a moving island of ice twice the size of the United States, Ice Station Grendel has been abandoned for more than seventy years. The twisted brainchild of the finest minds of the former Soviet Union, it was designed to be inaccessible and virtually invisible. But an American undersea research vessel has inadvertently pulled too close--and something has been sighted moving inside the allegedly deserted facility, something whose survival defies every natural law. And now, as scientists, soldiers, intelligence operatives, and unsuspecting civilians are drawn into Grendel&#39;s lethal vortex, the most extreme measures possible will be undertaken to protect its dark mysteries--because the terrible truths locked behind submerged walls of ice and steel could end human life on Earth.</p><p>Despite the submarine cover art and the rather awkward title, this is no by-the-numbers military thriller: rather, it's a full-blooded, multidimensional adventure story set in the frozen wilds of Alaska, both atop the ice and underneath it. And it's one heck of a fun ride. Matthew Pike is a Fish and Game officer cataloging bear populations in the remote Brooks Range--but he's also an ex-Green Beret, which comes in handy when trouble drops out of the sky in the form of a crashed bush plane, a cryptic survivor, and some very nasty and well-equipped pursuers. Meanwhile, an American submarine stumbles on an abandoned research station buried under the Arctic ice cap, unleashing a race to conceal the horrors that took place there and to capture the priceless scientific secret still locked within.<p> James Rollins invokes the polar environment so vividly you can hear the wind shriek and feel the ice forming on your nose, and the scientific/medical puzzles at the story's heart may remind you of Michael Crichton's best. The characters, while mostly familiar hero or villain types, are crisply drawn and in some cases quite sympathetic, but it's the nonstop action that carries you along. During several climactic chase scenes, you may find yourself laughing in pure delight--or gasping for breath--as Rollins keeps finding ways to ratchet up the tension one more notch. <i>Ice Hunt</i> is an escapist's delight. <i>--Nicholas H.

Two A.M. was a world to itself. </p><p>Zoya Filotova wore her black hair severely trimmed as if to defiantly display the bruise below her eye. She was about forty, Arkady thought, stylishly sinewy in a red leather pantsuit and a golden cross that was purely ornamental. She sat on one side of the booth, Arkady and Victor on the other, and although Zoya had ordered a brandy she had yet to touch it. She had long red fingernails and as she turned a cigarette pack over and over Arkady was put in mind of a crab inspecting dinner. The caf� was a chrome affair above a car wash on the beltway. No car washes tonight, not with snow falling, and the few cars that made it to the caf� were SUVs with four-wheel drive. The exceptions were Arkady's Zhiguli and Victor's Lada crouching in a corner of the lot.</p><p>Victor sipped a Chivas, just maintaining. Drinks were expensive and Victor had the patience of a camel. Arkady had a modest glass of water; he was a pale man with dark hair and the stillness of a professional observer. Thirty-six hours without sleep had made him more still than usual.</p><p>Zoya said, "My heart hurts more than my face."</p><p>"A broken heart?" Victor suggested as if it were his specialty.</p><p>"My face is ruined."</p><p>"No, you're still a beautiful woman. Show my friend what else your husband did."</p><p>The drivers and bodyguards who occupied stools along the bar were contemplative, cradling their drinks, sucking their cigarettes, keeping their balance. A couple of bosses compared Florida tans and snapshots of Sleeping Beauty. Zoya brushed the crucifix out of the way so she could unzip the top of her pantsuit and show Arkady a bruise that ran like a grape stain on the smooth plane of her breast.</p><p>"Your husband did this?" Arkady asked.</p><p>She zipped up and nodded.</p><p>"You'll be safe soon," Victor reassured her. "Animals like that should not be walking the street."</p><p>"Before we married he was wonderful. I have to say even now that Alexander was a wonderful lover."</p><p>"That's natural," Victor said. "You try to remember the good times. How long have you been married?"</p><p>"Three months."</p><p>Would the snow ever end? Arkady wondered. A Pathfinder rolled up to a gas pump. The mafia was getting conservative; now that they had seized and established their separate territories they were defenders of the status quo. Their children would be bankers and their children would be poets, something like that. Count on it, in fifty years, a golden age of poetry.</p><p>Arkady rejoined the conversation. "Are you sure you want to do this? People change their minds."</p><p>"Not me."</p><p>"Maybe your husband will change his ways."</p><p>"Not him." She smiled with an extra twist. "He's a brute. Now I don't dare go to my own apartment, it's too dangerous."</p><p>"You've come to the right place," Victor said and solemnized the moment with a sip. Cars droned by, each at a different pitch.</p><p>Arkady said, "We'll need phone numbers, addresses, keys. His routine, habits, where he hangs out. I understand you and your husband have a business near the Arbat."</p><p>"On the Arbat. Actually, it's my business."</p><p>"What sort?"</p><p>"Matchmaking. International matchmaking."</p><p>"What is the company's name?"</p><p>"Cupid."</p><p>"Really?" That was interesting, Arkady thought. A quarrel in Cupid's bower? "How long have you had this business?"</p><p>"Ten years." Her tongue rested for a moment on her teeth as if she were going to say more and changed her mind.</p><p>"You and your husband both work there?"</p><p>"All he does is stand around and smoke cigarettes and drink with his mates. I do the work, he takes the money and when I try to stop him, he hits me. I warned him, this was the last time."</p><p>Victor said, "So now you want him..."</p><p>"Dead and buried."</p><p>"Dead and buried?" Victor grinned. He liked a woman with zeal.</p><p>"And never found."</p><p>Arkady said, "What I need to know is how you knew to go to the police to have your husband killed."</p><p>"Isn't that how it's done?"</p><p>Arkady ceded her the point. "But who told you? Who gave you the phone number? It makes us nervous when an innocent citizen, such as yourself, knows how to reach us. Did you get our number from a friend or did a skywriter spell out Killers for Hire?"</p><p>Zoya shrugged. "A man left a message on my phone and said if I had a problem to call this number. I called and your friend answered."</p><p>"Did you recognize the voice on the message?"</p><p>"No. I think it was a kind soul who took pity on me."</p><p>"How did that kind soul get <i>your</i> phone number?" Victor asked.</p><p>"We advertise. We give our number."</p><p>"Did you save the message?"</p><p>"No, why would I want anything like that on my machine? Anyway, what does it matter? I can give you each two hundred dollars."</p><p>"How do we know this isn't a trap?" Arkady asked. "This phone thing bothers me. This could be a case of entrapment."</p><p>Zoya had a throaty, smoker's laugh. "How do I know you won't simply keep the money? Or worse, tell my husband?"</p><p>Victor said, "Any enterprise demands a certain amount of trust on both sides. To begin with, the price is five thousand dollars, half before and half after."</p><p>"I can get someone on the street to do it for fifty."</p><p>"You get what you pay for," Victor said. "With us, your husband's total disappearance is guaranteed and we'll handle the investigation ourselves."</p><p>"It's up to you," Arkady emphasized. "Your decision."</p><p>"How will you do it?"</p><p>Victor said, "The less you know about that the better."</p><p>Arkady felt he had a front row seat to the snow, to the way it tumbled in foamy waves over parked cars. If Zoya Filotova could afford an SUV, she could pay five thousand dollars to eliminate her husband.</p><p>"He's very strong," she said.</p><p>"No, he'll just be heavy," Victor assured her.</p><p>Zoya counted out a stack of much-handled American bills, to which she added a photograph of a man in a bathrobe at the beach. Alexander Filotov was alarmingly large, with long, wet hair and he was showing the camera a beer can he had apparently crushed with one hand.</p><p>"How will I know he's dead?" Zoya asked.</p><p>Victor said, "We'll give you proof. We take a picture."</p><p>"I've read about this. Sometimes so-called killers use makeup and catsup and pretend the 'victim' is dead. I want something more solid."</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>"More solid?" asked Victor.</p><p>"Something personal," Zoya said.</p><p>Arkady and Victor looked at each other. This was not in the script.</p><p>"A wristwatch?" Arkady suggested.</p><p>"More personal."</p><p>"As in...?" He didn't like where this was going.</p><p>Zoya finally picked up her brandy and sipped. "Don't kidnappers sometimes send a finger or an ear?"</p><p>There was another silence in the booth until Arkady said, "That's for kidnapping."</p><p>"That wouldn't work anyway," she agreed. "I might not recognize his ear or his finger. They all look pretty much alike. No, something more particular."</p><p>"What did you have in mind?"</p><p>She swirled her glass. "He has a pretty large nose."</p><p>Victor said, "I am not cutting off anybody's nose."</p><p>"If he's already dead? It would be like carving a chicken."</p><p>"It doesn't matter."</p><p>"Then I have another idea."</p><p>Victor put up his hand. "No."</p><p>"Wait." Zoya unfolded a piece of paper with a photograph of a drawing of a tiger fighting off a pack of wolves. The photo was murky, taken in poor light, and the drawing itself had an indistinct quality. "I thought of this."</p><p>"He has a picture?"</p><p>"He has a tattoo," Arkady said.</p><p>"That's right." Zoya Filotova was pleased. "I photographed the tattoo a few nights ago while he was in a drunken stupor. It's his own design."</p><p>A sheet covered one corner of the tattoo but what Arkady could see was impressive enough. The tiger stood majestically on its hind legs, one paw swiping the air as the wolves snarled and cringed. A pine forest and mountain stream framed the battle. On the white arm of a birch were the letters T, V, E, R.</p><p>Victor asked, "What does that mean?"</p><p>"He's from Tver," Zoya said.</p><p>"There are no tigers in Tver," Victor said. "No mountains either. It's a flat, hopeless dump on the Volga."</p><p>Arkady thought that was a little harsh, but people who made it to Moscow from places like Tver usually shed their hometown identity as fast as they could. They didn't have it inked on them forever.</p><p>"Okay," Victor said. "Now we can definitively ID him. How do you propose we bring the proof to you? Do you expect us to lug a body around?"</p><p>Zoya finished her brandy and said, "I need only the tattoo."</p><p></p><p>Arkady hated Victor's Lada. The windows did not completely close and the rear bumper was roped on. Snow blew in through floorboard holes and swayed the pine scent freshener that hung from the rearview mirror.</p><p>"Cold," Victor said.</p><p>"You could have let the car warm up." Arkady unbuttoned his shirt.</p><p>"It will, eventually. No, I'm talking about her. I felt my testicles turn to icicles and drop, one by one."</p><p>"She wants proof, the same as us." Arkady peeled adhesive tape from his stomach to free a microphone and miniature recorder. He pushed Rewind and Play, listened to a sample, turned off the recorder, ejected the cassette, and placed it in an envelope, on which he wrote, "Subject Z. K. Filotova, Senior Investigator A. K. Renko, Detective V. D. Orlov," date and place.</p><p>Victor asked, "What do we have?"</p><p>"Not much. You answered the phone on another officer's desk and a woman asked about doing in her husband. She assumed you were Detective Urman. You played along and set up a meeting. You could arrest her now for conspiracy but you'd have nothing on the detective and no idea who gave her his phone number. She's holding out. You could squeeze her harder if she pays for what she thinks is a finished assassination, then you'd have her for attempted murder and she might be willing to talk. Tell me about Detective Urman. It was his phone you answered?"</p><p>"Yes. Marat Urman. Thirty-five years old, single. He was in Chechnya with his buddy Isakov. Nikolai Isakov, the war hero."</p><p><i>"Detective</i> Isakov?" Arkady said.</p><p>Victor waited a beat. "I thought you'd like that. The file's in back."</p><p>Arkady covered his confusion by fishing a ribbon-bound fold...</p></p><h2>Oblomov (Everyman&#39;s Library)</h2><p><p><b>AN EVERYMAN'S LIBRARY HARDCOVER CLASSIC.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Ivan Goncharov&#x2019;s 1859 masterpiece&#x2014;a magnificent farce about a gentleman who spends the better part of his life in bed&#x2014;brilliantly employs humor to explore the absurdities and injustices of an outmoded social order. <br><br> Ilya Ilyich Oblomov is a good-hearted nobleman whose majestic slothfulness renders him incapable of making decisions or taking the simplest of actions. Raised in idyllic comfort on his family&#x2019;s country estate, he has become so lazy as an adult that he lets his affairs deteriorate and allows unscrupulous people to take advantage of his weakness and good nature. Living in a shabby apartment and tended by his indolent serf, Zahar, he relies on the efforts of his increasingly exasperated friend Stolz to protect him from himself. Falling in love briefly rouses Oblomov to exert himself in courting Olga, a young woman Stoltz introduces him to, but his astonishing lethargy eventually defeats even their romance. Wildly successful upon its publication, <i>Oblomov </i>was taken as a slyly subversive indictment of the uselessness and corruption of the nobility, but the character of Goncharov&#x2019;s superfluous man is rendered in such vivid detail and epic richness that it transcends satire and achieves iconic status, earning a place among the masterworks of Russian literature. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Translated by Natalie Duddington<br><br>(Book Jacket Status: Not Jacketed).</p></p><p>The sly, subversive side of the nineteenth-century Russian literary character -- the one which represents such a contrast to the titanic exertions of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky -- was most fully realized in Ivan Goncharov&#39;s 1859 masterpiece, OBLOMOV. This magnificent farce about a gentleman who spends the better part of his life in bed is a reminder of the extent to which humor, in the hands of a comic genius, can be used to explore the absurdities and injustices of a social order.Richard Freeborn is Emeritus Professor of English Literature at the University of London.

What's an author to do? After all, Will is responsible for such familiar phrases as "what's done is done" and "too much of a good thing." He even helped turn "household words" into household words. <br> &nbsp;<br> But, Jane embraces her dilemma, writing about Shakespeare, his plays, and his famous phrases with glee. After all, what better words are there to use to write about the greatest writer in the English language than his very own?&nbsp; As readers will discover, "the long and the short of it" is this: Will changed the English language forever.<br> &nbsp;<br> Backmatter includes an author&#x2019;s note, a bibliography, and a timeline.</p><p>JANE SUTCLIFFE is author of <i>Stone Giant: Michelangelo&#x2019;s David and How He Came to Be</i>, <i>The White House Is Burning: August 24, 1814</i>, and more than two dozen other books for children.

John lives in Norwich, England.Dear Reader:&nbsp;<br> We have to talk. I have failed you. I set out to write a book about the Globe Theatre and its great storyteller, William Shakespeare. About how the man was an absolute genius with words and wove those words into the most brilliant and moving plays ever written&nbsp;<br> But that&#x2019;s just the trouble. You see, I wanted to tell you the story in my own words. But Will Shakespeare&#x2019;s words are there, too, popping up all over the place.&nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s not my fault. Really. Will&#x2019;s words are everywhere. They&#x2019;re bumping into our words all the time, and we don&#x2019;t even know it. So how could I help it,<b> for goodness&#x2019; sake?</b><br> There, you see what I mean? Those are Will&#x2019;s words, all mixed in with mine. People just love his plays, and they&#x2019;ve kept on loving them for hundreds of years-<i>hundreds!</i> And the more they love his plays, the more they use his words. Now his words and sayings are everywhere, ending up in the stuff we say and write every day. I couldn&#x2019;t avoid them if I tried&#x2014;and I <i>did</i> try.&nbsp;<br> Well, I suppose<b> what&#x2019;s done is done.&nbsp;</b><br> Oh. Right. Maybe I&#x2019;ll just stop now and let you read the book.<br> Yours truly,&nbsp;<br> The Author</p><h2>Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan (Volume 2)</h2><p>"The ground was entirely new; there were no guide-books or guides; the whole was a virgin soil. At one time we stopped to cut away branches and vines which concealed the face of a monument, and then to dig around and bring to light a fragment, a sculptured corner of which protruded from the earth. I leaned over with breathless anxiety while the Indians worked, and an eye, an ear, a foot, or a hand was disentombed."<br>Few explorers have had the experience of uncovering a civilization almost entirely unknown to the world. But Stephen's two expeditions to Mexico and Central America in 1839 and 1841 yielded the first solid information on the culture of the Maya Indians. In this work, and in his other masterpiece <i>Incidents of Travel in Yucatan</i>, he tells the story of his travels to some 50 ruined Mayan cities.<br>In this book, he describes the excitement of exploring the magnificent ruined cities of Copan and Palenque, and his briefer excursions to Quirigua, Patinamit, Utatlan, Gueguetenango, Ocosingo, and Uxmal. For all these cities, his details are so accurate that more recent explorers used the book as a Baedeker to locate ruins forgotten by even the Indians.<br>In addition to being a great book on archaeological discovery, Stephen's work is also a great travel book. Telling of journeying by mule back on narrow paths over unimaginable deep ravines, through sloughs of mud and jungles of heavy vegetation, describing dangers of robbery, revolution, fever, mosquitoes and more exotic insects, Stephen's narrative remains penetrating and alive. His account of his attempt to buy Copan for $50 is told with the adroitness of a Mark Twain, and his descriptions of Indian life &#x2014; primitive villages a few miles from the ruins, burials, treatment of the sick, customs, amusements, etc. &#x2014; never lose their interest.<br>Frederick Catherwood's illustrations virtually double the appeal of the book. Highly exact, remarkably realistic drawings show overall views, ground plans of the cities, elevations of palaces and temples, free-standing sculpture, carved hieroglyphics, stucco bas-reliefs, small clay figures, and interior details.</p><p>John Lloyd Stephens (1805-1852) was an American politician who is renowned for his pioneering research into the ancient Maya civilisation. First published in 1841, this book describes the ancient Mayan sites he visited in 1839 and 1840. Volume 2 contains his descriptions of Palenque, Uxmal and other Mayan sites.Stephens's book, first published in two volumes in 1841, has been abridged by Karl Ackerman, a freelance writer. Stephens made his journey in 1839-40, accompanied by an artist, Frederick Catherwood, who made detailed drawings of the Mayan ruins. The book was extremely popular upon publication; it remains an exciting 19th-century travel work and one of the early descriptions--and an incisive one--of the Mayan ruins. Ackerman's abridgment makes a handsome volume, but the continuity is not smooth, and the work could do with more explanatory footnotes. There are no contemporary photographs, of course, but later ones by Edward Muybridge and others are used, including some of Tikal, which Stephens did not visit. The book is useful but will not replace the original work or subsequent reprints with Catherwood's drawings.<br><i>- George M. Jenks, Bucknell Univ., Lewisburg, Pa.</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Naked Public Square: Religion and Democracy in America</h2><p>Underlying the many crises in American life, writes Richard John Neuhaus, is a crisis of faith. It is not enough that more people should believe or that those who believe should believe more strongly. Rather, the faith of persons and communities must be more compellingly related to the public arena. "The naked public square"--which results from the exclusion of popular values from the public forum--will almost certainly result in the death of democracy.<br><br> The great challenge, says Neuhaus, is the reconstruction of a public philosophy that can undergird American life and America's ambiguous place in the world. To be truly democratic and to endure, such a public philosophy must be grounded in values that are based on Judeo-Christian religion. The remedy begins with recognizing that democratic theory and practice, which have in the past often been indifferent or hostile to religion, must now be legitimated in terms compatible with biblical faith.<br><br> Neuhaus explores the strengths and weaknesses of various sectors of American religion in pursuing this task of critical legitimation. Arguing that America is now engaged in an historic moment of testing, he draws upon Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish thinkers who have in other moments of testing seen that the stakes are very high--for America, for the promise of democratic freedom elsewhere, and possibly for God's purpose in the world.<br><br> An honest analysis of the situation, says Neuhaus, shatters false polarizations between left and right, liberal and conservative. In a democratic culture, the believer's respect for nonbelievers is not a compromise but a requirement of the believer's faith. Similarly, the democratic rights of those outside the communities of religious faith can be assured only by the inclusion of religiously-grounded values in the common life.<br><br><i>The Naked Public Square</i> does not offer yet another partisan program for political of social change. Rather, it offers a deeply disturbing, but finally hopeful, examination of Abraham Lincoln's century-old question--whether this nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure.</p><p>Richard John Neuhaus is editor-in-chief of the journal &#34;First Things&#34; and president of the Institute on Religion and Public Life, a research and education institute in New York City.<b>Christianity Today</b>,&nbsp;<i>Top 100 Books of the 20th Century</i>&nbsp;(2000)<br><br><b>George F.

Even as teenagers become increasingly independent, Joseph Micucci shows, they still need parental guidance and nurturance. By strengthening family relationships, clinicians can alleviate symptoms and promote behavioral change. Vivid examples and session transcripts illustrate specific strategies for treating eating disorders, depression, anxiety, defiance, underachievement, and other frequently encountered challenges.

His seminal books--<em>The Timeless Way of Building</em>, <em>A Pattern Language</em>, and <em>The Oregon Experiment</em>--defined a radical and fundamently new process of environmental design. Alexander now gives us the latest book in his series--a book that puts his theories to the test and shows what sort of production system can create the kind of environment he has envisioned.<br><br><em>The Production of Houses</em> centers around a group of buildings which Alexander and his associates built in 1976 in northern Mexico. Each house is different and the book explains how each family helped to lay out and construct its own home according to the family's own needs and in the framework of the pattern language. Numerous diagrams and tables as well as a variety of anecdotes make the day-today process clear.<br><br>The Mexican project, however, is only the starting point for a comprehensive theory of housing production. <em>The Production of Houses</em> describes seven principles which apply to any system of production in any part of the world for housing of any cost in any climate or culture or at any density.<br><br>In the last part of the book, "The Shift of Paradigm," Alexander describes, in detail, the devastating nature of the revolution in world view which is contained in his proposal for housing construction, and its overall implications for deep-seated cultural change.<br></p><p>The book centers around a group of buildings which Alexander and his associates built in 1976 in northern Mexico.

The personalities and events of Roman history have become part of the West's cultural lexicon, and Woolf provides brilliant retellings of each of these, from the war with Carthage to Octavian's victory over Cleopatra, from the height of territorial expansion under the emperors Trajan and Hadrian to the founding of Constantinople and the barbarian invasions which resulted in Rome's ultimate collapse. Throughout, Woolf carefully considers the conditions that made Rome's success possible and so durable, covering topics as diverse as ecology, slavery, and religion. Woolf also compares Rome to other ancient empires and to its many later imitators, bringing into vivid relief the Empire's most distinctive and enduring features.<br><br>As Woolf demonstrates, nobody ever planned to create a state that would last more than a millennium and a half, yet Rome was able, in the end, to survive barbarian migrations, economic collapse and even the conflicts between a series of world religions that had grown up within its borders, in the process generating an image and a myth of empire that is apparently indestructible. Based on new research and compellingly told, this sweeping account promises to eclipse all previously published histories of the empire.<br></p><p><br><strong>Greg Woolf</strong> is Professor of Ancient History at the University of St Andrews. He is the author of <em>Et Tu, Brute?: A Short History of Political Murder </em>and editor of <em>The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Roman World</em>.<br><br>"This latest volume from Professor Greg Woolf is a marvelous synthesis of the scholarship of, primarily, the last four decades on Rome's imperial successes and failures, rendered in an approachable and affable style of writing that is imbued throughout with useful anecdotes, quotes from primary sources, and summaries of the major scholarly positions. Woolf draws together rather complex lines of inquiry from numerous fields (including ecological and socio-political disciplines) and pieces together a narrative that educates, and points the reader to new theoretical directions that can be used to further illuminate the study of the topic at hand. ... Woolf has produced a useful review of the positions on Roman imperialism, a tour-de-force summary of the evolution of Rome from city-state to center of imperial power, and a really good read." --<em>New England Classical Journal</em><p></p><br>"In this passionately told exploration of the history of Rome, Woolf peers closely at what enabled Rome to resist defeats and capitalize on victories, and how it evolved to face new needs and new threats. With dazzling detail, Woolf retells the long story from Rome's birth in 753 B.C.E. to the republic, the empire, and the empire's fall" --<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Excellent...Understanding the history of Rome is not a simple task...for those already with such an interest, Woolf's book will be a joy to read. For those not yet intrigued by Rome, it may well set them on that path." --Adrian Goldsworthy, <em>The National Interest</em><p></p><br>"Exceptionally interesting and provocative reading." --Jonathan Yardley, <em>Washington Post</em><p></p><br>"Could [this] be the best single-volume introduction to the history of ancient Rome? It is conceptual yet avoids the pitfalls of overgeneralizing, a difficult balance to strike. It also has a superb (useful rather than exhaustive) bibliography. A good measure of books such as this is whether they induce you to read or order other books on the same topic and this one did. A sure thing to make my 'Best Books of 2012' list." --Tyler Cowen, <em>Marginal Revolution</em> <br><p></p><br>"This is a marvellous book. Woolf provides a sweeping history of Rome's rise and fall, and asks the big questions of why and how this happened. Better yet, he offers no simple or simplistic answers, but instead well considered discussion of the evidence and how we try to understand it." --Adrian Goldsworthy, author of <em>How Rome Fell: Death of a Superpower</em> and <em>Caesar: Life of a Colossus</em> <br><p></p><br>"Explanations for how Rome came to bestride the Mediterranean world puzzled ancient no less than modern historians, and Woolf's attention to enduring preoccupations, as with the fall of the republic and its succession by the emperors, endows his treatment with debate-like liveliness...a fine foundation for further learning about the Roman Empire." --<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"How a single-volume history of Rome could contain so much is beyond me. Ranging across time and space, and examining every facet of Roman civilization, it also places Rome's empire in the context of empires elsewhere, from China to Peru. Woolf has written what will surely establish itself as the definitive introduction to his subject." --Tom Holland, author of <em>Rubicon: The Triumph and Tragedy of the Roman Republic</em> and <em>Persian Fire: The First World Empire and the Battle for the West</em><p></p><br><em>Rome: An Empire's Story</em> is a terrific piece of work. It covers a vast chronological sweep briskly, from a wide and revealing variety of perspectives, and with a dazzling intellectual verve. The reader repeatedly encounters shrewd and often unexpected insights all along the way. Greg Woolf has given us a real tour de force of a book." --Nathan Rosenstein, Professor of History at The Ohio State University and author of <em>Rome and the Mediterranean, 290 to 146 BC</em><p></p><br>"How the Roman elite shaped an identity for itself and its many subjects is one theme of Greg Woolf's <em>Rome: An Empire's Story,</em> a remarkable work of synthesis that describes the rise, flourishing and decline of the Roman Empire...textbooks divide Roman history into the republican and imperial periods and fix the beginning of the empire proper to the age of Augustus. Not the least merit of Mr. Woolf's chronicle is its depiction of how misleading this division can be..." --<em>Wall Street Journal</em> <br><p></p><br>"Fifteen years ago, Greg Woolf published one of the best books ever written on the western Roman Empire (<em>Becoming Roman</em>). His new account of Rome's imperial history is hence something of an event....[a] grand new vision of the Roman empire." --<em>Times Literary Supplement</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Autonomous Technology: Technics-out-of-Control as a Theme in Political Thought</h2><p>The truth of the matter is that our deficiency does not lie in the want of well-verified &#34;facts.&#34; What we lack is our bearings. The contemporary experience of things technological has repeatedly confounded our vision, our expectations, and our capacity to make intelligent judgments. Categories, arguments, conclusions, and choices that would have been entirely obvious in earlier times are obvious no longer. Patterns of perceptive thinking that were entirely reliable in the past now lead us systematically astray. Many of our standard conceptions of technology reveal a disorientation that borders on dissociation from reality. And as long as we lack the ability to make our situation intelligible, all of the &#34;data&#34; in the world will make no difference.; From the Introduction</p><p>Langdon Winner is the Thomas Phelan Chair of Humanities and Social Sciences at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute."This study of the idea of technology out of control makes an important contribution to our understanding of the problems of civilization.

Rather, Winner is concerned with a more subtle effect: the artifacts that we have invented to satisfy our material wants have now developed, in size and complexity, to the point of delimiting or even determining our conception of the wants themselves.

Though the title may suggest an escapist fantasy, recent criticism has seen in the play a profoundly realistic psychology and a keen commentary on the violence implicit in family relationships and deep friendships. Orgel traces the changing critical and theatrical attitudes towards the play, and places its psychological and dramatic conflicts within the Jacobean cultural and political context. This edition is made complete with a reprint of Shakespeare's source for the play, Pandosto, by Robert Greene.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

This version aims to be different from other editions of the play. It invites you to bring the play to life in your classroom through enjoyable activities that will help increase your understanding. You are encourage to make up your own mind about the play, rather than have someone else&#39;s interpretation handed down to you. Whatever you do, remember that Shakespeare wrote his plays to be acted, watched and enjoyed.Founded in 1906 by J.M.

The fundamental argument of the book is that being is always &#x201c;being with,&#x201d; that &#x201c;I&#x201d; is not prior to &#x201c;we,&#x201d; that existence is essentially co-existence. Nancy thinks of this &#x201c;being-with&#x201d; not as a comfortable enclosure in a pre-existing group, but as a mutual abandonment and exposure to each other, one that would preserve the &#x201c;I&#x201d; and its freedom in a mode of imagining community as neither a &#x201c;society of spectacle&#x201d; nor via some form of authenticity. The five shorter essays impressively translate the philosophical insight of &#x201c;Being Singular Plural&#x201d; into sophisticated discussions of national sovereignty, war and technology, identity politics, the Gulf War, and the tragic plight of Sarajevo. The essay &#x201c;Eulogy for the M�l�e,&#x201d; in particular, is a brilliant discussion of identity and hybridism that resonates with many contemporary social concerns. As Nancy moves through the exposition of his central concern, being-with, he engages a number of other important issues, including current notions of the &#x201c;other&#x201d; and &#x201c;self&#x201d; that are relevant to psychoanalytic, political, and multicultural concepts.

From the medieval "Hymn of Caedmon" to George Orwell's "Why I Write," from Jane Austen to Ian McEwan, and from Winnie the Pooh to Dr. Johnson, this brilliant, compact survey stretches across the centuries, exploring the major literary forms (poetry, novel, drama, essay and more), the many histories and theories of the very idea of literature, and the role of writers in shaping English, British, and post-imperial identities. Bate illuminates the work of Chaucer, Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Dickens, and many other major figures of English literature. He looks at the Renaissance, Romanticism, and Modernism, at the birth of the novel and the Elizabethan invention of the idea of a national literature, and at the nature of writing itself. Ranging from children's literature to biography, this is an indispensable guide and an inspiration for anyone interested in England's magnificent literary heritage.<br></p><p><p></p><p><strong><i>English Literature</i>: Questions for Consideration and Discussion</strong> </p><p></p> <li>What have been the key texts for creating our images of Britain?

The soldiers, many still teenagers who had been in the country for three months, were on a "search and destroy" mission. The Tet Offensive had occurred only weeks earlier and in the same area and had made them jittery; so had mounting losses from booby traps and a seemingly invisible enemy. Three hours after the GIs entered the hamlets, more than five hundred unarmed villagers lay dead, killed in cold blood. The atrocity took its name from one of the hamlets, known by the Americans as My Lai 4. <br><br>Military authorities attempted to suppress the news of My Lai, until some who had been there, in particular a helicopter pilot named Hugh Thompson and a door gunner named Lawrence Colburn, spoke up about what they had seen. The official line was that the villagers had been killed by artillery and gunship fire rather than by small arms. That line soon began to fray. Lieutenant William Calley, one of the platoon leaders, admitted to shooting the villagers but insisted that he had acted upon orders. An expos� of the massacre and cover-up by journalist Seymour Hersh, followed by graphic photographs, incited international outrage, and Congressional and U.S. Army inquiries began. Calley and nearly thirty other officers were charged with war crimes, though Calley alone was convicted and would serve three and a half years under house arrest before being paroled in 1974.<br><br>My Lai polarized American sentiment. Many saw Calley as a scapegoat, the victim of a doomed strategy in an unwinnable war. Others saw a war criminal. President Nixon was poised to offer a presidential pardon. The atrocity intensified opposition to the war, devastating any pretense of American moral superiority. Its effect on military morale and policy was profound and enduring. The Army implemented reforms and began enforcing adherence to the Hague and Geneva conventions. Before launching an offensive during Desert Storm in 1991, one general warned his brigade commanders, "No My Lais in this division--do you hear me?"<br><br>Compelling, comprehensive, and haunting, based on both exhaustive archival research and extensive interviews, Howard Jones's <em>My Lai</em> will stand as the definitive book on one of the most devastating events in American military history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Howard Jones</strong> is University Research Professor of History Emeritus at the University of Alabama, where he taught for thirty-nine years.

Sure, she's still a fierce intimidator of her little brother and Charlie Brown, but he's learned to strike back with a deft pair of pliers, a huge sand castle or snow dinosaur, or merely the will to walk up and change the channel. Lucy also continues her pursuit of the oblivious musician, Schroeder (contrary to the advice of Dear Agnes). Snoopy continues his impersonations (vulture, penguin, etc.), plays baseball and football, angsts over being called "fuzzy-face or "dime a dozen," and dances gleefully on Schroeder's piano. Charlie Brown, of course, has very little glee, especially when he has to manage a dysfunctional baseball team that only wins if he's sick or when the championship is riding on his catching a simple pop fly. But at least he has his pencil pal. Charles M. Schulz by this time was comfortably in his routine of multi-day stories, and there's a bit of foreshadowing when Schroeder, wildly inventing names of imaginary pianists, comes up with "Joseph Schlabotnik," which would later become the name of CB's baseball hero. The volume has an introduction by author Jonathan Franzen and a Sunday strip from May 3, 1953, which was discovered after the 1953-54 volume was printed. <i>--David Horiuchi</i>Charles M. Schulz was born November 25, 1922, in Minneapolis. His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip Barney Google).In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 Ripley's Believe It or Not! installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the Saturday Evening Post&#x2015;as well as, to the local St. Paul Pioneer Press, a weekly comic feature called Li'l Folks. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, Li'l Folks. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become Peanuts&#x2015;and that was what sold. (The title, which Schulz loathed to his dying day, was imposed by the syndicate.) The first Peanuts daily appeared October 2, 1950; the first Sunday, January 6, 1952.Diagnosed with cancer, Schulz retired from Peanuts at the end of 1999. He died on February 13, 2000, the day before Valentine's Day&#x2015;and the day before his last strip was published&#x2015;having completed 17,897 daily and Sunday strips, each and every one fully written, drawn, and lettered entirely by his own hand&#x2015;an unmatched achievement in comics.<br><br>Barack Obama is the 44th President of the United States.</p><h2>The Museum of Modern Love</h2><p><b>An Amazon Editors&#x2019; Best Book of December 2018<br><br> &#x201c;Art will wake you up.

Although some go in skeptical, almost all leave moved. And the participants are not the only ones to find themselves changed by this unusual experience: Arky finds himself drawn to the exhibit. He returns day after day to watch other people sit with Abramovi&#x107;&#x2014;and as he does, he begins to understand what might be missing in his life and what he must do.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of December 2018:</strong> In any other hands, this novel centered around performance artist Marina Abramovic&#x2019;s famous 2010 MoMA exhibit titled The Artist Is Present might not have worked. But Heather Rose&#x2019;s poetic language, at once both accessible and heart-searing, is also a work of art. Movie composer Arky Levin is depressed and isolated from the family he&#x2019;s known for 24 years after being written out of his wife&#x2019;s legal wishes when she falls into a coma. He should be working on music for a new animated movie, but instead he finds himself sitting on the sidelines watching Marina&#x2019;s silent performance every day, and over time, he is completely changed by the experience. This is a captivating story on the improbability of life, the power of art to transform our pain, a meditation on the fluidity of time, and the ruse of human separation. <em>--Marlene Kelly</em><b>Heather Rose</b> was born in Australia in 1964.

When the stranger mysteriously reappears, with specific demands for reparation, the Graffes&#x2019; circle of idiosyncratic family and friends is disrupted&#x2014;for the demands are bizarre, intrusive, and ultimately fatal.</p><p>In a small circle of friends in London, some disturbing occurrences are taking place: Lucas Graffe, a reclusive academic, kills a man in self-defense, and disappears immediately after the trial, leaving his brother, the charismatic actor Clement Graffe, tortured by his absence. Their friend Bellamy James rids himself of all ties and possessions, even giving away his beloved dog. Yearning for simplicity and purification, he prepares himself for a monastic life. And outside Clifton, the house where the widowed Louise Anderson lives with her three eccentric daughters, a very peculiar man is watching. Lucas finally returns, and during his reunion with his brother they happen to receive a surprising visitor. It soon becomes clear to the Graffes and their friends that there is a complex mission to fulfill, of revenge, but also of transformation.

Coomaraswamy, curator of Indian art at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, uniquely combined art historian, philosopher, orientalist, linguist, and expositor in his person. His knowledge of the arts and handcrafts of the Orient was unexcelled and his numerous monographs on Oriental art either established or revolutionized entire fields. He was also a great Orientalist, with an almost unmatched understanding of traditional culture. He covered the philosophic and religious experience of the entire premodern world, east and west, and for him primitive, medieval European, and classical Indian experiences of truth and art were only different dialects in a common language.<br>Finally, Coomaraswamy was a provocative writer, whose erudition was expressed in a delightful, aphoristic style. The nine essays in this book are among his most stimulating. They discuss such matters as the true function of aesthetics in art, the importance of symbolism, and the importance of intellectual and philosophical background to the artists; they demonstrate that abstract art and primitive art, despite superficial resemblances, are completely divergent; and they deal with the common philosophy which pervades all great art, the nature of medieval art, folklore, and modern art, the beauty inherent in mathematics, and the union of traditional symbolism and individual portraiture in premodern cultures.</p><p></p></p><p>The late A. K. Coomaraswamy, curator of Indian art at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, uniquely combined the roles of art historian, philosopher, orientalist, linguist, and expositor. His knowledge of the arts and handcrafts of the Orient was unsurpassed, and his numerous monographs on Oriental art either established, or revolutionized, entire fields. Coomaraswamy was one of the foremost Orientalists of his time, with an almost unmatched understanding of traditional culture. He mastered the philosophic and religious terrain of the entire premodern world, East and West; and for him primitive, medieval European, and classical Indian experiences of truth and art were only different dialects of a common language.</p><h2>The Baker&#39;s Daughter</h2><p><p><strong>A stranger came to town and stole her heart</strong></p><p>Sue Pringle has never met anyone like John Darnay before.

Stevenson's earliest and most beloved novels,<em> The Baker's Daughter</em> is a heartwarming story of finding love in unexpected places.</p></p><p>D.E. Stevenson (1892-1973) had an enormously successful writing career; between 1923 and 1970, four million copies of her books were sold in Britain and three million in the United States.<p><strong>Chapter One</strong></p> <p>A curlew, winging its way across southern Scotland, would see the little town of Beilford as a handful of gray pebbles cast down on the banks of the river Beil. It is all gray-gray stone houses, gray roofs, and gray stones paving the streets-for the stone of which it was built came from the quarry at the base of the Castle Rock. </p> <p>The castle is the seat of Sir James Faulds and is one of the oldest inhabited buildings in the land; it is set upon the cliff overlooking the town, and here the river makes a double bend before flowing away southeastward to the sea.</p> <p>Beilford is an old town with an East Gate and a West Gate-narrow arches set in thick walls-and the street that runs from one to the other through the middle of the town is narrow and winding. On market days this street is congested with traffic, for Beilford is the shopping center of a prosperous farming community-ironmongers, saddlers, butchers, and drapers all thrive well-at one end of the High Street, near the West Gate, a fine frontage displays the sign of THOMAS BULLOCH, WINE MERCHANT AND ITALIAN WAREHOUSEMAN.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Thomas Bulloch was a well-respected man in Beilford. He had inherited his business from his father and had extended it by hard work and capable management. His shop was patronized not only by the townspeople, but also by the surrounding landowners, for he had a large and varied assortment of goods and his prices were moderate. The shop was served by a good staff of assistants, but Mr. Bulloch could quite often be seen there himself, for he believed it to be good policy to show a personal interest in his customers, and he enjoyed the work. When Mr. Bulloch was not in the shop he was probably in his office at the back of the premises-a queer stone chamber, three-cornered in shape, wedged in between his ample storehouses-here he sat, day after day, writing letters, interviewing travelers and agents, ordering wines and spirits, butter and bacon, oranges and spices, and a hundred and one necessities and luxuries that it was his business to retail.</p> <p>There was a very fine smell in this wedge-shaped office, for Mr. Bulloch liked to keep samples of his wares on the shelves that lined its walls: tins of fruit, jars of ginger, glasses of preserves, spices and cereals and dried fruits of all kinds, and, in a very special cupboard that was always locked, a few bottles of very special wines, liqueurs, and brandies. When any of Mr. Bulloch's old customers had reason to visit the shop-customers such as Sir James Faulds of Beil or Admiral Sir Rupert Lang of Bonnywall-they made a beeline for Mr. Bulloch's sanctum, knowing full well that they would be welcomed there and regaled with a glass of old brown sherry and a thin biscuit or perhaps asked to sample some especially delectable brand of ginger or fine cigar. The gentlemen liked that, but perhaps the chief attraction that brought them to "Bulloch's den" was the man himself.</p> <p>Bulloch was tall and big boned, with shaggy white eyebrows and strong white hair. The eyes beneath the shaggy brows were gray and keen. There was something birdlike about the straight glance, the slightly hooky nose, and the big spare frame, and when Admiral Lang remarked to the Earl that Bulloch reminded him of "a benevolent eagle," the Earl was startled at the aptness of the comparison. There was dignity in Bulloch, and wisdom, and a quiet humor.</p> <p>One cold November day, Mr. Bulloch was sitting at his desk in his wedge-shaped office. Ostensibly he was engaged in writing a letter to his agent in Calcutta to point out that the last consignment of Orange Pekoe had been distinctly below standard, but the pen had fallen from his hand and he was staring with unseeing eyes at the small coal fire that winked and blinked cheerfully in the polished grate. Today was Mr. Bulloch's birthday, and birthdays are the milestones of life, inviting reflection upon the road that has been traveled, or the road that lies ahead. At seventy there is more road behind than in front, and Mr. Bulloch was looking backward down the years. He was looking back a long way, forty-five years or more, to his courtship of Susan Smart, to their marriage and the happy days that followed. He thought of the birth of his only child, Mary, and of the joy that the baby daughter had brought to the comfortable house above the shop. Those were happy times, thought Mr. Bulloch. Mary's childhood, Mary's school days-how quickly they passed!</p> <p>When Mary was barely nineteen she had married Will Pringle, the baker whose premises were at the other end of the street. It was a good enough match as far as money went, for the bakery was a large and prosperous concern, but Will was dour and taciturn, with no humor and less kindliness in him, and the Bullochs had never been able to like him however hard they tried. They could not understand what Mary saw in Will, but they had always given her all she wanted, and a habit of this kind is hard to break. To do Will justice, he had been very fond of Mary and good to her in his own way, and as far as his limitations would permit. Mary had borne him two children: a girl who was named Sue after her grandmother and a boy named Alexander. The years sped on-they were calm, contented years in retrospect-and then the blow had fallen.</p> <p>Mr. Bulloch sighed, for Mary's death did not bear thinking of-it was so unnecessary. If only they had realized in time that her cold was serious! If they had put her to bed and had proper advice she might be alive now! They did all they could when once they knew, but it was too late then, for pneumonia is swift and cruel and tarries for no man.</p> <p>One evening, when Mr. Bulloch was sitting with Mary, she had opened her eyes for a moment, and seeing him there, she had caught at his hand and whispered, "Dad, take care of Sue; she's too serious." She had drifted away into unconsciousness again before he could answer, but he had known then that there was no hope: Mary was dying.</p> <p>Sue was fourteen when her mother died, and Will took her away from school to keep house for him. The neighbors talked about it-as neighbors do-some saying that Will Pringle had no right to take the child from school, and others that it was the best training she could have, and she would make a better wife when the right man came along.</p> <p>Nobody predicted that Will would remarry, for Will was no "ladies' man," and he seemed quite comfortably off with Sue as housekeeper. He waited a long time-until his daughter was twenty-two-and then electrified Beilford with the news that he was going to take a second wife. It is possible, of course, that he may have envisaged Sue's marriage (for there were several young men who would have been glad to have her) and looked about him for a wife-housekeeper before it was too late, or he may have fallen in love with plump Grace Simpson. Nobody knew what was in Will Pringle's head and nobody was ever likely to know, for he was a man who kept his own counsel.</p> <p>Will's remarriage was a shock to the Bullochs, for they had not forgotten Mary, and her place in their hearts could never be filled, but they kept their bitter feelings to themselves and were friendly and pleasant to Will's new wife. It was necessary that they should keep on good terms with the Pringles on account of the grandchildren.</p> <p>All this passed through Mr. Bulloch's mind as he sat and stared at the fire, and then, because he was weary of unhappiness, he switched his mind back to the happy times and thought again of the young Mary-of Mary the child. What a gay, pretty creature she was, a fairy princess who had danced her way through life! They had all sorts of foolish little jokes together, he and Mary, and childish secrets and games. And they read fairy tales, for these were her chief delight-Mr. Bulloch sitting in the big armchair and Mary on the floor by his knee. The tale of Goldilocks and the Three Bears was their favorite (Mary's own hair was spun gold) and he had read it to her so often that, even now, he knew it off by heart: "...and when Goldilocks reached the little cottage in the woods, she crept up to the door and knocked softly-three little taps, and then three little taps again, and then another three little taps for luck..." And always Mary had knocked upon Mr. Bulloch's office door in the same way, with three times three little taps so that he would know it was Goldilocks calling on the Big Bear. Then, before he had time to answer, she would rush in, laughing merrily, her gold hair blown about by the wind, and swinging her schoolbooks at the end of a little strap. "Big Bear!" she would cry. "It's teatime now; school's over for the day!" Mr. Bulloch had that little strap still-it was in his table drawer, a queer keepsake for a hardheaded businessman.</p> <p>It was this gay, irresponsible creature who had said to him, "Take care of Sue; she's too serious," and Mr. Bulloch often pondered on the words. Did Mary realize that life is hard on serious people and that her own lightheartedness had saved her from hurt?</p></p><h2>Now We Are Six Deluxe Edition (Winnie-the-Pooh)</h2><p><i>When We Were Very Young</i> and <i>Now We Are Six</i> complete the four-volume set of deluxe editions of the Milne and Shepard classic works.

The volume presents a new translation of Takiji&#x2019;s fiercely anticapitalist <i>Kani k&#x14d;sen&#x2015;</i>a classic that became a runaway bestseller in Japan in 2008, nearly eight decades after its 1929 publication. It also offers the first-ever translations of <i>Yasuko </i>and <i>Life of a Party Member,</i> two outstanding works that unforgettably explore both the costs and fulfillments of revolutionary activism for men and women. The book features a comprehensive introduction by Komori Y&#x14d;ichi, a prominent Takiji scholar and professor of Japanese literature at Tokyo University.</p><p><b>Zeljko (Jake) Cipris</b> is assistant professor of Japanese at the University of the Pacific, Stockton.From time to time, as Japan has faced various postwar crises, popular interest in proletarian literature has revived.

Despite extreme discomfort and occasional danger, mother and daughter, a formidable duo, were unflagging in their sympathetic response to the perilous beauty and impoverished people of the Andes.</p><p>Dervla Murphy is one of the very best loved of travel writers. She was born in County Waterford and since 1964 has been regularly publishing accounts of her journeys - by bicycle and on foot - in the remoter areas of four continents. She has also written about the problems of Northern Ireland, the hazards of nuclear power, and race relations in Britain. The Times Literary Supplement called her &#39;an admirable woman - she has a romantic soul and a keen eye&#39;.Armchair travelers should take note of Dervla Murphy&#39;s trek through the Andes with her nine-year-old daughter.

Hurley's study focuses on the steel mill community of Gary, Indiana, a city that was sacrificed, like a thousand other American places, to industrial priorities in the decades following World War II. Although this period witnessed the emergence of a powerful environmental crusade and a resilient quest for equality and social justice among blue-collar workers and African Americans, such efforts often conflicted with the needs of industry. To secure their own interests, manufacturers and affluent white suburbanites exploited divisions of race and class, and the poor frequently found themselves trapped in deteriorating neighborhoods and exposed to dangerous levels of industrial pollution. In telling the story of Gary, Hurley reveals liberal capitalism's difficulties in reconciling concerns about social justice and quality of life with the imperatives of economic growth. He also shows that the power to mold the urban landscape was intertwined with the ability to govern social relations.<br><br></p><p>"Hurley's well-written and well-organized work is a social and environmental history of the unequal distribution of environmental problems caused by industrial production processes. . . .

This is both her story and that of children just like her: one filled with ups and downs amid bizarre goings-on and crimes perpetrated by greedy and corrupt adults. From a trove of primary documents, including court and census records and interviews with family members, author Tonya Bolden painstakingly pieces together the events of Sarah&#x2019;s life and the lives of those around her.<br> The book includes a glossary, a bibliography, and an index.<br> <br> <b>Praise for <i>Searching for Sarah Rector</i></b><br> <b>STARRED REVIEW</b><b>S</b><br> "This handsome volume with its many photographs is carefully sourced and has a helpful glossary, illustration credits and index.

She lives in New York City.<b><p></p></b>Gr 6&#x2013;8&#x2014;When Sarah Rector turned 18 in 1920, the young black woman had amassed a fortune estimated at $1 million. In telling her story, Bolden makes a largely unknown portion of American history accessible to young readers. Rector and her family were "Creek freedmen," black citizens of the Creek Indian nation. When the Creeks were forced to resettle west of the Mississippi in the 1800s, each one received a land allotment. Sarah's contained rich oil deposits, making her enormously wealthy. As a result, there was great media interest in her whereabouts and lifestyle, though much of the reporting was highly inaccurate and speculative. When she disappeared, the black-owned newspaper the Chicago Defender and the NAACP even suggested that Sarah had been kidnapped and that her legal guardians were profiting at her expense. All of this was untrue. In telling Rector's story, Bolden admittedly had to deal with gaps in information. Yet, piecing together the facts clearly reflects Bolden's skill as a history writer-her rigorous questioning of documents; her own clearly stated position on what the "facts" mean; and her extensive use of visual material, such as newspaper articles, maps, paintings, and photographs. In an author's note, Bolden tells how she first learned about Sarah, how she researched her life, and how-in the process-she found evidence that was contrary to what she expected. This book will be extremely useful to teachers and librarians seeking material to align with Common Core State Standards dealing with the craft of writing of informational text. Pair it with Bolden's Maritcha (Abrams, 2005), another book that deals with the challenges of writing history when there are gaps in available historical evidence.&#x2014;Myra Zarnowski, City University of New York</p><h2>The Man from Beijing</h2><p><p><b>From the dean of Scandinavian&nbsp;noir, Henning Mankell, the internationally bestselling and&nbsp;universally acclaimed Kurt Wallander series, an incredible stand-alone masterpiece: a bone-chilling mystery that spans two centuries and four continents.</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>In the far north of Sweden a small, quiet village has been almost entirely wiped out by a mass murderer. The only clue left at the scene is a red ribbon. Among the victims are the grandparents of Judge Birgitta Roslin, who sets out to find the killer. Despite being brushed off by the police, Birgitta is determined to prove that the murders were not a random act of violence but are part of something far more dark and complex. Her investigation leads to the highest echelons of power and into the recesses of history where the seeds of evil deeds were planted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Henning Mankell is the internatinally acclaimed, bestselling author of the Kurt Wallander novels.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mankell's novels have been translated into forty-five languages and have sold more than forty million copies worldwide. He was the first winner of the Ripper Award and also received the Glass Key and the Crime Writers&#x2019; Association Golden Dagger, among other awards. His Kurt Wallander mysteries have been adapted into a PBS television series starring Kenneth Branagh. During his life, Mankell divided his time between Sweden and Mozambique, where he was artistic director of the Teatro Avenida in Maputo. He died in 2015.<br><br></p>The Epitaph<br><br>1<br><br>Frozen snow, severe frost. Midwinter.<br><br>Early in January 2006 a lone wolf crosses the unmarked border and enters Sweden from Vauldalen in Norway. A man on a snowmobile thinks he might have glimpsed it just outside Fj�lln�s, but the wolf vanishes into the trees heading east before he is able to pinpoint it. In the remote Norwegian �sterdalarna Mountains it had discovered a lump of frozen moose carcass, with remnants of meat still clinging to the bones. But that was more than two days ago. It is beginning to feel the pain of hunger and is desperately searching for food.<br><br>The wolf is a young male that has set out to find a territory of his own. He continues his way eastward. At N�vjarna, north of Linsell, he finds another moose carcass. For a whole day he stays and eats his fill before resuming his trek east. When he comes to K�rb�le he trots over the frozen Ljusnan and then follows the river along its winding route toward the sea. One moonless night he lopes silently over the bridge at J�rvs�, then heads into the vast forests that stretch to the coast.<br><br>In the early morning of January 13 the wolf reaches Hesj�vallen, a tiny village south of Hansesj�n Lake in H�lsingland. He pauses and sniffs the air. He detects the smell of blood. He looks around. There are people living in the houses but no smoke rising from the chimneys. His sharp ears can&#x2019;t detect the slightest sound.<br><br>But the wolf is in no doubt about the blood. He skulks at the edge of the forest, nose in the air. Then he moves forward, silently, through the snow. The smell comes from one of the houses at the far end of the hamlet. He is vigilant now&#x2014;with humans around it&#x2019;s essential to be both careful and patient. He pauses again. The smell originates from the back of the house. He waits. Then eventually starts moving once more. When he gets there he finds another carcass. He drags his large meal back to the trees. He has not been discovered, not even the village dogs have stirred. The silence is total this freezing cold morning.<br><br>The wolf starts eating when he comes to the edge of the trees. It is easy, as the flesh has not yet frozen. He is very hungry now. Having pulled off a leather shoe, he starts gnawing away at an ankle.<br><br>It snowed during the night but stopped before dawn. As the wolf eats his fill, snowflakes once again start dancing down toward the frozen ground.<br><br>2<br><br>When Karsten H�glin woke up he remembered dreaming about a photograph. He lay motionless in bed and felt the image returning slowly, as if the negative of his dream were sending a copy into his conscious mind. He recognized the picture. It was black and white and depicted a man sitting on an old iron bed, with a hunting rifle hanging on the wall and a chamber pot at his feet. When he saw it for the first time, he had been gripped by the old man&#x2019;s wistful smile. There was something timorous and evasive about him. Much later Karsten had discovered the background. A few years earlier the man had accidentally shot and killed his only son while hunting seabirds. From then on the rifle had never come down from the wall, and the man had become a hermit.<br><br>H�glin thought that of all the thousands of photographs and negatives he had seen, this was the one he would never forget. He wished he had taken it himself.<br><br>The clock on his bedside table read half past seven. H�glin usually woke up very early, but he had slept badly that night, the bed and its mattress were uncomfortable. He made up his mind to complain about them when he checked out of the hotel.<br><br>It was the ninth and final day of his journey. It had been made possible by a scholarship enabling him to study deserted villages and other small settlements that were being depopulated. He had come as far as Hudiksvall and had one hamlet left to photograph. He had chosen this particular one because an old man who lived there had read about his project and sent him a letter. H�glin had been impressed by the letter and decided that this was the place for him to conclude his study.<br><br>He got up and opened the curtains. It had snowed during the night and was still gray, the sun not yet risen. A bundled-up woman was cycling past in the street below. Karsten considered her and wondered how cold it was. Negative five degrees Celsius, possibly negative seven.<br><br>He dressed and took the slow-moving elevator down to reception. He had parked his car in the enclosed courtyard behind the hotel. It was safe there. Even so, he had taken all his photographic equipment up to his room, as was his practice. His worst nightmare was to come to his car one day and find that all his cameras had vanished.<br><br>The receptionist was a young girl, barely out of her teens. He noticed that her makeup was slapdash and gave up on the idea of complaining about the bed. After all, he had no intention of ever returning to the hotel.<br><br>In the breakfast room a few guests were absorbed in their morning papers. For a fleeting moment he was tempted to get a camera and take a shot. It gave him the feeling that Sweden had always been exactly like this. Silent people, poring over their newspapers with a cup of coffee, absorbed in their own thoughts, their own fates.<br><br>But he resisted the temptation, served himself coffee, buttered two slices of bread, and tucked into a soft-boiled egg. Without a newspaper, he ate quickly. He hated being at a meal on his own without anything to read.<br><br>It was colder than he expected when he emerged from the hotel. He stood on tiptoe to read the thermometer in the reception window. Negative eleven degrees. And falling, he suspected. This winter has been far too warm. Here comes the cold spell we&#x2019;ve been expecting. He put his cases on the backseat, started the engine, and began scraping ice off the windshield. There was a map on the passenger seat. The previous day, after taking pictures of a village not far from Lake Hassela, he had worked out how to get to his final port of call: take the main road southward, turn off toward S�rforsa near Iggesund, then follow either the east or the west shore of the lake called Storsj�n in some parts and L�ngsj�n in others. The guy at the gas station on the way into Hudiksvall had warned him that the east road was bad, but he decided to take it anyway. It would be quicker. And the light was so lovely this winter morning. He could already envisage the smoke rising straight up to the sky from the chimneys.<br><br>It took him forty minutes to get there. By then he had already made a wrong turn, a road leading southward to N�cksj�.<br><br>Hesj�vallen was situated in a little valley by a lake whose name he couldn&#x2019;t recall. Hesj�n, maybe? The dense forests extended all the way to the hamlet, on both sides of the narrow road leading up toward H�rjedalen.<br><br>Karsten stopped at the edge of the tiny village and got out of the car. There were breaks in the clouds now. The light would become more difficult to capture, perhaps not so expressive. He looked around. Everything was very still. The houses gave the impression of having been there since time immemorial. In the distance he could hear the faint noise of traffic on the main road.<br><br>He suddenly felt uneasy. He held his breath, as he always did when confronted with something he didn&#x2019;t really understand.<br><br>Then it dawned on him&#x2014;the chimneys, they were cold. There was no sign of smoke, which would have been an effective feature of the photographs he hoped to take. His gaze moved slowly from house to house. Somebody&#x2019;s cleared the snow already, he thought. But not lit a single fire? He remembered the letter he&#x2019;d received from the man who had told him about the village. He had referred to the chimneys and how the houses seemed, in a childish sort of way, to be sending smoke signals to one another.<br><br>He sighed. People don&#x2019;t write the truth, but what they think you want to read. Now should I take pictures with cold chimneys or abandon the whole business? Nobody was forcing him to take photographs of Hesj�vallen and its inhabitants. He already had plenty of pictures of the Sweden that was fading away: the derelict farms, the remote villages whose only hope of survival was that Danes and Germans would buy up the houses and turn them into summer cottages. He decided to leave and returned to his car. But he didn&#x2019;t start the engine. He had come this far; the least he could do was to try to create some portrait of the local inhabitants&#x2014;he wanted faces. As the years passed, Karsten H�glin had become increasingly fascinated by elderly people. He wanted to compile an album: pictures that would describe the beauty found only in the faces of very old women, their lives and hardships etched into their skin like the sediment in a cliff wall.<br><br>He got out of his car again, pulled his fur hat down over his ears, picked out a Leica M6 he&#x2019;d been using for the past ten years, and made for the nearest of the group of houses. There were ten in all, most of them timber and painted red, some with added stoops. He could see only one modern house. If it could still be called modern, that is&#x2014;a 1950s detached house. When he came to the gate, he paused and raised his camera. The nameplate indicated that the Andr�n family lived there. He took a few shots, varying the aperture setting and exposure time, trying out several angles, though it was clear that there wasn&#x2019;t enough light yet and he would get only an indistinct blur. But you never know. Photographers sometimes expose unexpected secrets.<br><br>H�glin was intuitive with his work. Not that he didn&#x2019;t bother to measure light levels when required, but sometimes he&#x2019;d pull off surprising results without paying attention to carefully calculated exposure times. Improvisation went with the territory.<br><br>The gate was stiff. He had to push hard in order to open it. There were no footprints in the newly fallen snow. Still not a sound, not even a dog. It&#x2019;s deserted, he thought. This isn&#x2019;t a village; it&#x2019;s a Flying Dutchman.<br><br>He knocked on the front door, waited, then knocked again. Nothing. He began to wonder what was going on. Something was amiss. He knocked again, harder and longer. Then he tried the door handle. Locked. Old people scare easily, he thought. They lock their doors and worry that all the things they read about in the papers are going to happen to them.<br><br>He banged on the door. Nothing. He concluded there must not be anybody at home.<br><br>He went back through the gate and moved on to the next house. It was starting to get lighter now. The house was painted yellow. The putty around the windows was coming off&#x2014;it must be very drafty inside. Before knocking he tried the door handle. Locked again. He knocked hard, then began banging away even before anybody could possibly have had time to answer. Once again, empty.<br><br>If he went back to his car now, he would be at home in Pite� by early afternoon. That would please his wife. She was convinced that he was too old to be embarking on all these trips, despite the fact that he was only sixty-three. But he had been diagnosed with symptoms of imminent angina. The doctor had advised him to watch what he ate and try to get as much exercise as possible.<br><br>One last try. He went around to the back of the house and tried a door that seemed to lead to a utility room behind the kitchen. That was also locked. He went to the nearest window, stood on tiptoe, and looked in. He could see through a gap in the curtains into a room with a television set. He continued to the next window. It was the same room, and he could still see the TV. A tapestry hanging on the wall informed him that jesus is your best friend. He was about to move on to the next window when something on the floor attracted his attention. At first he thought it was a ball of wool just lying there. Then he saw that it was a woolly sock, and that the sock was on a foot. He stepped back from the window. His heart was pounding. Was that really a foot? He went back to the first window, but he couldn&#x2019;t see as far into the room from there. He went on to the second window. Now he was certain. It really was a foot. A motionless foot. He couldn&#x2019;t be sure if it was a man&#x2019;s or a woman&#x2019;s. The owner of the foot might be sitting in a chair. It was hard to make out&#x2014;but if so why hadn&#x2019;t the person stirred?<br><br>He knocked on the window as hard as he dared, but there was no response. He took out his cell phone and dialed the emergency number. No signal. He ran to the third house and banged on the door. Nothing. He felt like he was in the middle of a nightmare. He picked up a foot scraper, smashed the door lock, and forced his way in. He had to find a telephone. There was an old woman lying on the kitchen floor. Her head was almost totally severed from her neck. Beside her lay the carcass of a dog, cut in two.<br><br>H�glin screamed and turned to flee. As he ran through the hall he saw the body of a man sprawled on the floor of the living room, between the table and a red sofa with a white throw. The old man was naked. His back was covered in blood.<br><br>H�glin raced out of the house. He couldn&#x2019;t get away fast enough. He dropped his camera when he reached the road but didn&#x2019;t stop to pick it up. He was convinced that somebody or something he couldn&#x2019;t see was about to stab him in the back. He turned his car and sped away. <br><br>He stopped when he reached the main road, then dialed the emergency number, his hands shaking uncontrollably. As he raised the phone to his ear, he felt a sharp pain in his chest. It was as if somebody had caught up with him and stabbed him. He could hear someone speaking to him on the phone, but he was incapable of answering. The pain was so intense that all he could manage<br>was a faint hiss.<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t hear you,&#x201d; said a woman&#x2019;s voice.<br><br>He tried again. Once more nothing but a faint hiss. He was dying.<br><br>&#x201c;Can you speak a bit louder?&#x201d; asked the woman. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand what you&#x2019;re saying.&#x201d;<br><br>He made a supreme effort and produced a few words.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m dying,&#x201d; he gasped. &#x201c;For God&#x2019;s sake, I&#x2019;m dying. Help me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d;<br><br>But the woman received no reply. Karsten H�glin was on his way into the endless darkness. In a desperate attempt to escape from the excruciating pain, like a drowning man trying in vain to rise to the surface, he stepped on the gas. The car shot over to the wrong side of the road. A truck on the way to Hudiksvall carrying office furniture had no chance to avoid a head-on collision. The truck driver jumped down from his cab to check on the driver of the car he had crashed into. H�glin was prostrate over the steering wheel. <br><br>The truck driver, from Bosnia, spoke little Swedish.<br><br>&#x201c;How is you?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;The village,&#x201d; mumbled Karsten H�glin. &#x201c;Hesj�vallen.&#x201d;<br><br>Those were his final words. By the time the police and the ambulance arrived, Karsten H�glin had succumbed to a massive heart attack.<br><br>It was not at all clear what had happened. Nobody could possibly have guessed the reason for the sudden heart attack suffered by the man behind the wheel of the dark blue Volvo. It wasn&#x2019;t until Karsten H�glin&#x2019;s body had been taken away and tow trucks were trying to extricate the badly damaged furniture van that a police officer bothered to listen to the Bosnian driver. The officer&#x2019;s name was Erik Hudd�n, and he didn&#x2019;t like talking to people who spoke bad Swedish unless he was forced to. It was as if their stories were less important if they were unable to articulate them properly. Naturally, the officer began with a Breathalyzer. But the driver<br>was sober, and his driver&#x2019;s license seemed to be in order.<br><br>&#x201c;He tried saying something,&#x201d; said the truck driver.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Hudd�n asked dismissively.<br><br>&#x201c;Something about Her�. A place, perhaps?&#x201d;<br><br>Hudd�n was a local, and shook his he...</p><h2>The Coming of Post-Industrial Society: A Venture in Social Forecasting</h2><p>In 1976, Daniel Bell's historical work predicted a vastly different society developing one that will rely on the economics of information&#x201d; rather than the economics of goods.&#x201d; Bell argued that the new society would not displace the older one but rather overlie some of the previous layers just as the industrial society did not completely eradicate the agrarian sectors of our society. The post-industrial society's dimensions would include the spread of a knowledge class, the change from goods to services and the role of women. All of these would be dependent on the expansion of services in the economic sector and an increasing dependence on science as the means of innovating and organizing technological change.Bell prophetically stated in <i>The Coming of the Post-Industrial Society</i> that we should expect new premises and new powers, new constraints and new questions with the difference that these are now on a scale that had never been previously imagined in world history.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Daniel Bell</b> is the Henry Ford II Professor of Social Sciences Emeritus at Harvard University and Scholar-in-Residence at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Flinn&#39;s book will teach the reader how to avoid the pitfalls of bad screenwriting and arrive at one&#39;s own destination intact.</p><p><i>How Not to Write a Screenplay</i> is an invaluable addition to any aspiring screenwriter's shelf--and you'd best make the shelf within arm's reach of the computer. Author Dean Martin Flinn, an experienced script reader, details the common rookie mistakes that drive script readers crazy. Flinn makes no pretense of being able to teach anyone how to write the next Great American Film--or for that matter the next Stupid Summer Blockbuster. Instead he offers information that will help keep the novice screenwriter's opus from being immediately tossed on the trash pile (arguably a more valuable service). As Flinn says in his introduction, if you follow the advice in this book, "you may not write a particularly good screenplay, but you won't write a bad one." Flinn offers practical advice on formatting, such as the proper form for a slugline and where to set your margins, and more general rules of thumb on giving the actors room to interpret their roles and avoiding dictating camera angles to the director (who will ignore them anyway). The second half of the book deals with content, also in a remarkably pragmatic way--structure, pacing, plot resolution, and dialogue that really stink are all handily dealt with. Flinn illustrates almost all his points with excerpts from screenplays both good and bad (names have been changed to protect the guilty), giving the reader concrete examples of the difference between poorly and well-structured scenes. Not sucking is an unusual goal for a screenwriting manual, but any script reader will agree it is a noble one. <i>--Ali Davis</i><b>Denny Martin Flinn</b> was an American screenwriter.

Far more immediate is the earthy life of the forest itself and the deep sensations of childhood it recalls from Grange&#x2019;s memory. Ostensibly readying for war, Grange instead spends his time observing the change in seasons, falling in love with a young free-spirited widow, and contemplating the absurd stasis of his present condition. This novel of long takes, dream states, and little dramatic action culminates abruptly in battle, an event that is as much the real incursion of the German army into France as it is the sudden intrusion of death into the suspended disbelief of life. Richard Howard&#x2019;s skilled translation captures the fairy-tale otherworldliness and existential dread of this unusual, elusive novel (first published in 1958) by the supreme prose stylist Julien Gracq.</p><p><b>Julien Gracq&nbsp;</b>(1910&#x2013;2007) was born Louis Poirier in Saint-Florent-le-Vieil, a small village in western France. An excellent student and a voracious reader, he studied in Paris in the early&nbsp;1930s, where he encountered the work of Andr� Breton and the surrealists. His first book, <i>Au Ch�teau d&#x2019;Argol</i> (<i>The Castle of Argol</i>, 1938) was praised by Breton as the first surrealist novel. In 1940, as a lieutenant in the French army, Gracq was captured by the Germans and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in Silesia. Following the war and his release, he became a geography and history teacher at a lyc�e in Paris, where he remained for more than twenty years. He taught as&nbsp;Louis Poirier and wrote as Julien Gracq, a name that combined his favorite Stendhal character, Julien Sorel, and the Roman Gracchus brothers. Opposed to publicity and self-promotion, Gracq declined three requests from Fran�ois Mitterand to dine at the president&#x2019;s residence and refused the Prix Goncourt when he was awarded it for his 1951 novel <i>Le Rivage des Syrtes</i> (<i>The Opposing Shore</i>). Unmarried, in 1970 he retired from teaching and returned to his hometown,&nbsp;where he lived with his sister until her death in 1996. He continued writing throughout his life, publishing novels, plays, poetry, and literary criticism.<br><br> <b>Richard Howard&nbsp;</b>is the author of seventeen volumes of poetry and has published more than one hundred fifty translations from the French, including, for NYRB, Marc Fumaroli&#x2019;s <i>When the</i>&nbsp;<i>World Spoke French</i>, Balzac&#x2019;s<i> Unknown Masterpiece</i>, and Maupassant&#x2019;s <i>Alien Hearts</i>.

Julien Gracq has written a sensitive and analytical study of men enmeshed in a phony war&#x2014;a war that would ultimately result in the tragic, dramatic fall of France.... The facile pen of the author is evident on every page, especially in the descriptive passages of the phantom forest, the seasonal landscape colors, and the beauty of nature in contrast with man&#x2019;s destructiveness in wartime.

Published as an autobiography and praised by Edgar Allan Poe, this is the story of a young idler who goes in search of buried treasure and finds instead the power to transfer his soul into other men's bodies. What follows is one&nbsp;increasingly practiced body snatcher's&nbsp;picaresque journey through early American pursuits of happiness, as each new form Sheppard Lee assumes disappoints him anew while making him want more and more. When Lee's metempsychosis draws him into the marriage market, the money market, and the slave market, Bird's fable of American upward mobility takes a more sinister turn. Lee learns that everything in America, even virtue and vice, are interchangeable; everything is an object and has its price.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Looking forward to Melville's <i>The Confidence-Man </i>and beyond that to William Burroughs&#x2019;s <i>Naked Lunch</i>, this strange and compelling story is a penetrating critique of American life and values as well as&nbsp;a crucial addition to the canon of American literature.</p><p><b>Robert Montgomery Bird </b>(1803&#x2014;1854) was born in Delaware and raised in Philadelphia. He attended the University of Pennsylvania and graduated from its medical school in 1824.

Moving up and down the social and economic ladder in New Jersey, Philadelphia, and Virginia, <i>Sheppard Lee</i> embodies, among other identities, a gouty brewer, a miserly moneylender, and a slave. Equal parts comedy of manners, satire of sentimentality, and critique of antebellum political culture, <i>Sheppard Lee</i> also offers a vivid portrait of early American life."<br>&#x2014; Justine Murison, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign<br><br>"An unjustly forgotten masterpiece, <i>Sheppard Lee</i> inspired Poe's tales of metempsychosis, 'The Gold Bug,' and the juiciest parts of Melville's <i>Israel Potter</i>.

The books are set mainly in Avignon and the ancient kingdom of Provence, though significant episodes in the quintet are set in the Egyptian desert, Venice, Paris, Vienna and Geneva.</p><p>Lawrence Durrell was born in 1912 in India. He attended the Jesuit College at Darjeeling and St Edmund&#39;s School, Canterbury. His first literary work, The Black Book, appeared in Paris in 1938. His first collection of poems, A Private Country, was published in 1943, followed by the three Island books: Prospero&#39;s Cell, Reflections on a Marine Venus, about Rhodes, and Bitter Lemons, his account of life in Cyprus. Durrell&#39;s wartime sojourn in Egypt led to his masterpiece, The Alexandria Quartet, which he completed in southern France where he settled permanently in 1957. Between the Quartet and The Avignon Quintet he wrote the two-decker Tunc and Nunquam. His oeuvre includes plays, a book of criticism, translations, travel writing, and humorous stories about the diplomatic corps. Caesar&#39;s Vast Ghost, his reflections on the history and culture of Provence, including a late flowering of poems, appeared a few days before his death in Sommieres in 1990.</p><h2>Consequences Of Pragmatism: Essays 1972-1980</h2><p>Rorty seeks to tie philosophy&#x2019;s past to its future by connecting what he sees as the positive (and neglected) contributions of the American pragmatic philosophers to contemporary European developments. What emerges from his explorations is a revivified version of pragmatism that offers new hope for the future of philosophy.&#x201c;Rorty&#x2019;s dazzling tour through the history of modern philosophy, and his critical account of its present state (the best general introduction in print), is actually an argument that what we consider perennial problems--mind and body, consciousness and objects, the foundations of knowledge, the fact/value distinction--are merely the dead-ends this picture leads us into.&#x201d; Los Angeles Times Book Review&#x201c;It can immediately be said that Consequences of Pragmatism must be read by both those who believe that they agree and those who believe that they disagree with Richard Rorty. [He] is far and away the most provocative philosophical writer working in North America today, and Consequences of Pragmatism should make this claim even stronger.&#x201d;The Review of Metaphysics&#x201c;Philosophy, for Rorty, is a form of writing, a literary genre, closer to literary criticism than anything else, a criticism which takes for one of its major concerns the texts of the past recognized as philosophical: it interprets interpretations. If anyone doubts the continued vigor and continuing relevance of American pragmatism, the doubts can be laid to rest by reading this book.&#x201d; Religious Studies Review</p><p></p><h2>Oil &amp; Acrylic: Oceans &amp; Seascapes: Discover the secrets to painting waves, open seas, and coastal scenes step by step (How to Draw &amp; Paint)</h2><p><p>Capture breathtaking oceanic scenes in oil and acrylic with <i>Oceans &amp; Seascapes</i>.

Though physical appearance is idolised for its sexual appeal and its social identity, the role of the body in developing a full understanding of the physical world and the human condition has become neglected. The potential of the human body as a knowing entity &#x2013; with all our senses as well as our entire bodily functions being structured to produce and maintain silent knowledge together &#x2013; fails to be recognised. <p>It is only through the unity of mind and body that craftsmanship and artistic work can be fully realised. Even those endeavours that are generally regarded as solely intellectual, such as writing and thinking, depend on this union of mental and manual skills.</p> <p>In <i>The Thinking Hand</i>, Juhani Pallasmaa reveals the miraculous potential of the human hand. He shows how the pencil in the hand of the artist or architect becomes the bridge between the imagining mind and the emerging image. The book surveys the multiple essences of the hand, its biological evolution and its role in the shaping of culture, highlighting how the hand&#x2013;tool union and eye&#x2013;hand&#x2013;mind fusion are essential for dexterity and how ultimately the body and the senses play a crucial role in memory and creative work. Pallasmaa here continues the exploration begun in his classic work <i>The Eyes of the Skin</i> by further investigating the interplay of emotion and imagination, intelligence and making, theory and life, once again redefining the task of art and architecture through well-grounded human truths.</p></p><p><b>Juhani Pallasmaa</b> is one of Finland&#x2019;s most distinguished architects and architectural thinkers.

He has also held visiting professorships in several universities internationally. Pallasmaa is the author/editor of 24 books, including <i>The Eyes of the Skin: Architecture and the Senses</i> (Academy, 1995 and John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005), <i>The Architecture of Image: Existential Space in Cinema</i> (Helsinki, 2001) and <i>Encounters</i> (Helsinki, 2005).&#34;The Thinking Hand is a superb piece of writing.

There are enormous differences between the two in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, and a monolingual speaker of one cannot understand the other at all. Yet modern English and German have many points in common, and if we go back to the earliest texts available in the two languages, the similarities are even more notable.</p><br><p>How do we account for these similarities? The generally accepted explanation is that English and German are divergent continuations of a common ancestor, a Germanic language now lost. This book surveys the linguistic and cultural backgrounds of the earliest kown Germanic languages, members of what has traditionally been known as the English family tree: Gothic, Old Norse, Old Saxon, Old English, Old Frisian, Old Low Franconian, and Old High German.</p><br><p>For each language, the author provides a brief history of the people who spoke it, an overview of the important texts in the language, sample passages with full glossary and word-by-word translations, a section on orthography and grammar, and discussion of linguistic or philological topics relevant to all the early Germanic languaes but best exemplified by the particular language under consideration. These topics inclued the pronunciation of older languages; the runic inscriptions; Germanic alliterative pietry; historical syntax, borrowing, analogy, and drift; textual transmission; and dialect variation.</p></p><p>&#x201c;The task of writing a book like Robinson&#x2019;s is very difficult.

Who hasn&#x2019;t been delighted by a right-on-time delivery, one of the 18 million UPS makes every day? Founded over a hundred years ago, UPS has moved steadily up the Fortune 500 while so many other corporations have disappeared. What&#x2019;s the company&#x2019;s secret? <br><br> Just ask a driver!<br><br> Ron Wallace was a UPS delivery driver for six years before he began rising through the ranks, ultimately becoming president of UPS International. In other companies, that might be extraordinary, but at UPS it&#x2019;s par for the course. UPS has a unique corporate culture. It&#x2019;s like a family. Package loaders call executives by their first names and vice versa. The company almost always promotes from within. Lifetime employment is common. Most employees own UPS stock. Wallace credits the company&#x2019;s success&#x2014;and his own&#x2014;to its culture of &#x201c;we, not me.&#x201d; As he puts it, working at UPS gave him a PhD in teamwork. <br><br> Instead of writing a typical business memoir that celebrates the leader as celebrity, Wallace shares vivid stories that focus on the people he worked with, the challenges they overcame, and the simple principles and practices that make up the UPS way. He exhorts his readers to grow their people, not just their business plans. The leadership style described in this book is simple and direct&#x2014;and it works. The straightforward and easy-to-understand lessons provide a blueprint for an individual or company to build on past successes and adapt to future challenges. This is a must-read for anyone aspiring to become a great leader.</p><p>Ron Wallace rose from driver to president of UPS International.

And what a fascinating story they tell together: one that brims with an all-star cast of characters, eye-opening details, and unexpected detours through the annals of human civilization and scientific discovery.<br> &nbsp;<br> Enter critically acclaimed writer and popular journalist Victoria Finlay, who here takes readers across the globe and over the centuries on an unforgettable tour through the brilliant history of color in art. Written for newcomers to the subject and aspiring young artists alike, Finlay&#x2019;s quest to uncover the origins and science of color will beguile readers of all ages with its warm and conversational style. Her rich narrative is illustrated in full color throughout with 166 major works of art&#x2015;most from the collections of the J. Paul Getty Museum.<br> &nbsp;<br> Readers of this book will revel in a treasure trove of fun-filled facts and anecdotes. Were it not for Cleopatra, for instance, purple might not have become the royal color of the Western world. Without Napoleon, the black graphite pencil might never have found its way into the hands of C�zanne. Without mango-eating cows, the sunsets of Turner might have lost their shimmering glow. And were it not for the pigment cobalt blue, the halls of museums worldwide might still be filled with forged Vermeers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Red ocher, green earth, Indian yellow, lead white&#x2015;no pigment from the artist&#x2019;s broad and diverse palette escapes Finlay&#x2019;s shrewd eye in this breathtaking exploration.</p><p>Victoria Finlay is the author of <i>Color: A Natural History of the Palette</i> and <i>Jewels: A Secret History</i>. She was formerly arts editor at the South China Morning Post.Gr 9 Up&#x2014;Who knew that colors have such fascinating stories to tell? Finlay does a wonderful job of describing, in clear, accessible, witty language, how artists around the world, from prehistoric times to the present, have used natural materials, including charcoal, soot, plants, insects, shells, and gems and minerals, to produce magnificent paint and ink colors that continue to dazzle. Today, though, synthetic paints and even computers produce an astonishing range of hues. Browsers and cover-to-cover readers will find some tantalizing information here. For example, Vincent van Gogh once ate his toxic chromium yellow paint; Santa Claus wasn't always clothed in red; thanks to Isaac Newton, there are seven colors in the rainbow; human and animal body wastes were once essential ingredients in color production; and some commonplace colors were created by sheer accident. The handsomely designed book includes 166 excellent reproductions of artworks, many from the collections of Los Angeles's J. Paul Getty Museum. It is filled with illuminating captions and sidebars; reproductions have been perfectly chosen and placed to illustrate the author's narratives; and a "brilliant history of color" is a compelling, readable account of humankind's yearning to express itself beautifully since the beginning of time. An illustration list and lengthy index are included. Recommended for large public library collections and for school libraries; useful in art classes, particularly in units on art history/appreciation, drawing, and painting.&#x2014;Carol Goldman, Queens Library, NY</p><h2>Chang, Chemistry, 2016, 12e, AP Student Edition (AP CHEMISTRY CHANG)</h2><p>Chang's best-selling general chemistry textbook takes a traditional approach and is often considered a student and teacher favorite.

The whole West is contained in the burst of sadistic laughter of the American soldiers, as it is behind the construction of the Israeli wall. This is where the truth of these images lies. Truth, but not veracity. As virtual as the war itself, their specific violence adds to the specific violence of the war. In <i>The Conspiracy of Art</i>, Baudrillard questions the privilege attached to art by its practitioners. Art has lost all desire for illusion: feeding back endlessly into itself, it has turned its own vanishment into an art unto itself. Far from lamenting the "end of art," Baudrillard celebrates art's new function within the process of insider-trading. Spiraling from aesthetic nullity to commercial frenzy, art has become transaesthetic, like society as a whole. Conceived and edited by life-long Baudrillard collaborator Sylv�re Lotringer, The Conspiracy of Art presents Baudrillard's writings on art in a complicitous dance with politics, economics, and media. Culminating with "War Porn," a scathing analysis of the spectacular images from Abu Ghraib prison as a new genre of reality TV, the book folds back on itself to question the very nature of radical thought.</p></p><p>Jean Baudrillard (1929&#x2013;2007) was a philosopher, sociologist, cultural critic, and theorist of postmodernity who challenged all existing theories of contemporary society with humor and precision.

Written for classroom teachers (K-12, ESL, EFL), this book teaches the most common ELL grammar points in an accessible way through real ELL errors with suggested teaching techniques. Relevant grammar terminology is explained where practical.&nbsp;The four objectives of the book are to help teachers: (1) identify common ELL grammar points and understand the details associated with each one; (2) improve their ability to answer any grammar question on the spot (when on the "hot seat"); (3) anticipate common ELL errors by grammar point, by first language, and by proficiency level; and (4) develop more effective grammar/language learning lessons.&nbsp;The presentation of each of the 15 keys (grammar points) features information on typical ELL errors, an accessible grammar explanation including examples of mistakes, a native language interference chart, and ideas for teaching the grammar point.&nbsp;<p>The&nbsp;Workbook for <i>Keys to Teaching Grammar to English Language Learners </i>provides extra practice in the grammar points studied in the handbook.</p></p><p>Keith S.

KAIZEN uses more than 100 examples in action and contains 15 corporate case studies.</p><p>Books about Japanese management have become kind of a cottage industry, from Theory Z ( LJ 5/1/81) to The Art of Japanese Management ( LJ 8/1/81) and The Mind of the Strategist ( LJ 6/1/82) to Kaisha: the Japanese corporation ( LJ 12/85). This volume covers some of the same groundthe current superiority of Japanese management stylebut approaches things from a different perspective. Essentially, Imai contends that the Japanese edge can be found in a philosophical orientation captured in the concept of Kaizen. Kaizen management is anchored in the notion of perpetual improvementeven if all is going well. In contrast to U.S.-style management, it takes a longer-run view and is process-oriented rather than geared to immediate results. Importantly, the Kaizen philsophy is also quantifiable , rooted in the mathematics of quality control theory. Recommended.

This revolutionary paper challenged certain basic assumptions underlying much research in mathematics and logic. G�del received public recognition of his work in 1951 when he was awarded the first Albert Einstein Award for achievement in the natural sciences&#x2014;perhaps the highest award of its kind in the United States. The award committee described his work in mathematical logic as "one of the greatest contributions to the sciences in recent times."</p> <p>However, few mathematicians of the time were equipped to understand the young scholar's complex proof. Ernest Nagel and James Newman provide a readable and accessible explanation to both scholars and non-specialists of the main ideas and broad implications of G�del's discovery. It offers every educated person with a taste for logic and philosophy the chance to understand a previously difficult and inaccessible subject.</p> <p>New York University Press is proud to publish this special edition of one of its bestselling books. With a new introduction by Douglas R. Hofstadter, this book will appeal students, scholars, and professionals in the fields of mathematics, computer science, logic and philosophy, and science.</p></p><p>G�del's incompleteness theorem--which showed that any robust mathematical system contains statements that are true yet unprovable within the system--is an anomaly in 20th-century mathematics. Its conclusions are as strange as they are profound, but, unlike other recent theorems of comparable importance, grasping the main steps of the proof requires little more than high school algebra and a bit of patience. Ernest Nagel and James Newman's original text was one of the first (and best) to bring G�del's ideas to a mass audience. With brevity and clarity, the volume described the historical context that made G�del's theorem so paradigm-shattering. Where the first edition fell down, however, was in the guts of the proof itself; the brevity that served so well in defining the problem made their rendering of G�del's solution so dense as to be nearly indigestible.<p> This reissuance of Nagel and Newman's classic has been vastly improved by the deft editing of Douglas Hofstadter, a prot�g� of Nagel's and himself a popularizer of G�del's work. In the second edition, Hofstadter reworks significant sections of the book, clarifying and correcting here, adding necessary detail there. In the few instances in which his writing diverges from the spirit of the original, it is to emphasize the interplay between formal mathematical deduction and meta-mathematical reasoning--a subject explored in greater depth in Hofstadter's other delightful writings. <i>--Clark Williams-Derry</i></p><p><b>Ernest Nagel</b> was John Dewey Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University.</p></p><h2>Henry James : Novels 1886-1890: The Princess Casamassima, The Reverberator, The Tragic Muse (Library of America)</h2><p>The three novels in this Library of America volume from Henry James&#x2019;s middle period explore some historical and social dilemmas that belong as much to our time as to his own.&nbsp;<i>The Princess Casamassima</i>&nbsp;was published in 1886, a year that saw riots of the unemployed in London. It is a political novel in which anarchists and terrorists conspire within a&nbsp;<i>fin de si�cle</i>&nbsp;world of opulence and glamour. The action ranges from palaces to slums, from London to Paris to Venice and back again. The novel&#x2019;s hero, Hyacinth Robinson, is torn between his loyalty to revolutionary causes&#x2014;for which he is about to commit an act of violence that may cost him his life&#x2014;and his taste for the artistic side of aristocratic culture, represented in part by the beautiful, wealthy, compassionate, and yet deceptive Princess of the title. Possibly to save Hyacinth, she becomes romantically involved with his fellow conspirator Paul Muniment, a calculating political operative, idealistic and treacherous by turns. Assassination plots, sexual betrayals, murder, suicide, and the fierce play of conflicting loyalties&#x2014;all these bring into play an intricate abundance of attendant figures, like the rakish Captain Sholto and the appealing but faithless Millicent Henning.<br><br><i>The Reverberator</i>&nbsp;(1888) is a swiftly paced comic novel named after a newspaper that caters to the American public&#x2019;s appetite for the &#x201c;society news of every quarter of the globe.&#x201d; Francie Dosson, the free-spirited daughter of a wealthy Boston family, innocently provides gossip to George Flack, a &#x201c;young commercial American&#x201d; who writes for the paper. His published report imperils her engagement to Gaston Probert, whose family is outraged by the airing of its secrets. James portrays the collision of easily shocked Old World propriety and self-assured New World naivet� with benevolent affection and spirited delight.<br><br><i>The Tragic Muse</i>&nbsp;(1890) explores with a topical realism not usually found in James the conflicts between art and politics, society and the Bohemian life. It does so with dazzling glimpses of Parisian theater and of London aestheticism, as articulated by the flamboyant and idealistic Gabriel Nash. At its center are four superbly drawn characters. The fascinating Miriam Rooth is an actress of overwhelming egotistic vitality and dedication to her art. Her suitor, the diplomat Peter Sherringham, is impassioned by her theatrical talent even while asking her to sacrifice it for his career. Nick Dormer faces a similar predicament in his engagement to the rich Julia Dallow, who wants him to forgo his painting so as to make use of her fortune in pursuit of his career in Parliament. Full of witty talk and vividly dramatic scenes, the novel includes a vast array of characters such as the impressive political matriarch Lady Dormer. Perhaps more than any of his novels, it attests to James&#x2019;s recognition of the costs of any dedication, like his own, to creative achievement.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

He spent his early life in America and studied in Geneva, London and Paris during his adolescence to gain the worldly experience so prized by his father. He lived in Newport, went briefly to Harvard Law School, and in 1864 began to contribute both criticism and tales to magazines.<p>In 1869, and then in 1872-74, he paid visits to Europe and began his first novel, <b>Roderick Hudson</b>. Late in 1875 he settled in Paris, where he met Turgenev, Flaubert, and Zola, and wrote <b>The American</b> (1877). In December 1876 he moved to London, where two years later he achieved international fame with <b>Daisy Miller</b>. Other famous works include <b>Washington Square</b> (1880), <b>The Portrait of a Lady</b> (1881), <b>The Princess Casamassima</b> (1886), <b>The Aspern Papers</b> (1888), <b>The Turn of the Screw</b> (1898), and three large novels of the new century, <b>The Wings of the Dove</b> (1902), <b>The Ambassadors</b> (1903) and <b>The Golden Bowl</b> (1904). In 1905 he revisited the United States and wrote <b>The American Scene</b> (1907).</p><p>During his career he also wrote many works of criticism and travel. Although old and ailing, he threw himself into war work in 1914, and in 1915, a few months before his death, he became a British subject. In 1916 King George V conferred the Order of Merit on him. He died in London in February 1916.</p>This volume contains the novels The Princess Casamassima (1886), The Reverberator (1888), and The Tragic Muse (1890) along with a chronology of James's life and notes from scholar Fogel . Since it provides three novels on permanent paper at a reasonable price, this edition should be considered by every literature collection.-- MR<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Faith in a Seed: The Dispersion Of Seeds And Other Late Natural History Writings (A Shearwater Book)</h2><p>An anthology of Thoreau&#39;s later writings on natural history--including The Dispersion of Seeds, which draws on Darwin&#39;s theory of natural selection--discusses the role of seeds and seed dispersal in the ecological succession of plant species.</p><p>Gary Paul Nabhan is an internationally celebrated nature writer, food and farming activist, and proponent of conserving the links between biodiversity and cultural diversity. He has been been honored as a pioneer and creative force in the &#x201c;local food movement&#x201d; and seed saving community by <i>Utne Reader</i>, <i>Mother Earth News</i>, <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Bioneers</i>, and <i>Time </i>magazine. <br> As the W.K. Kellogg Endowed Chair in Sustainable Food Systems at the University of Arizona Southwest Center, he works with students, faculty and non-profits to build a more just, nutritious, sustainable, and climate-resilient foodshed spanning the U.S./Mexico border. He was among the earliest researchers to promote the use of native foods in preventing diabetes, especially in his role as a co-founder and researcher with Native Seeds/SEARCH. Gary is also personally engaged as an orchard-keeper, wild foods forager, and pollinator habitat restorationist working from his small farm in Patagonia, Arizona near the Mexican border. He has helped forge &#x201c;the radical center&#x201d; for collaborative conservation among farmers, ranchers, indigenous peoples and environmentalists in the West. He played key roles in establishing the Ironwood Forest National Monument, community-based seed banks, land reserves for conserving wild crop relatives, and restored habitats for migratory pollinators throughout the West.<br> Agricultural historian Peter Hatch of Monticello has called Nabhan &#x201c;the lyrical scholar of genetic diversity.&#x201d; As an Arab-American essayist and poet, he is author or editor of twenty-four books, some of which have been translated into Arabic, Spanish, Italian, French, Croation, Korean, Chinese and Japanese. For his creative writing and its influence on community-based conservation, he has been honored with a MacArthur &#x201c;genius&#x201d; award, a Lannan Literary Fellowship, a Southwest Book Award, the John Burroughs Medal for nature writing, the Vavilov Medal, and several honorary degrees and lifetime achievement awards.<br> He works most of the year as a research scientist at Tumamoc Hill and the Southwest Center of the University of Arizona, but he is also engaged with several food justice and farming alliances, including Sabores Sin Fronteras, Santa Cruz Valley Heritage Alliance, Wild Farm Alliance, Renewing America&#x2019;s Food Traditions, and the Borderlands Habitat Restoration Initiative. Nabhan is humbled and honored to serve as a professed Ecumenical Franciscan brother, helping the Franciscan Action Network in shaping ethical responses to environmental injustice, to immigration issues, and to climate change.<br> &nbsp;For Thoreauvians, botanists, agriculturalists, and scholars of 19th-century America, this book represents nothing less than a triumph of editorial skill and integrity over conventional wisdom. A study of plant ecology using Darwinian theory, Faith in a Seed is one of the more interesting books published in our time, so felicitously does it give readers a fresh dose of all that makes Thoreau such a major figure in American letters. The holograph of The Dispersion of Seeds , Thoreau's last major project (as well as the manuscript of Wild Fruits, selections of which appear here along with two other writings probably intended for the title volume) was dismissed by most of the scholars who even knew of it as being taxonomically suspect, uninterestingly concrete, and "best left unpublished." How wrong. It is, in fact, the book that latter-day Thoreau admirers have often wished he had written: sensual, acute, intricate, and altogether fascinating, a text that should cause scholars to reevaluate their assessment of an important writer.

Bronislaw Malinowski, one of the all-time great anthropologists of the world, had a talent for bringing together in single comprehension the warm reality of human living with the cool abstractions of science. His pages have become an almost indispensable link between the knowing of exotic and remote people with theoretical knowledge about humankind. This volume--originally published in 1922--can be considered the founding document of economic anthropology, and remains the best one to read. It emphasizes the great significance of primitive economics by singling out the notable exchange system of the Trobriand Islands for special consideration. Although the main theme is economic, constant reference is made in this milestone of anthropological research and interpretation to social organization, life and meaning, the power of magic, and to mythology and folklore.<p> Title of related interest also available from Waveland Press: Malinowski, <i>Magic, Science and Religion and Other Essays</i> (ISBN 9780881336573.</p></p><p>Bronislaw Malinowski (1884-1942), Anglo-Polish anthropologist, was born in what was then Austrian Poland of a long line of Polish nobility and landed gentry.

He also studied at the University of Leipzig and later went on to London, where from 1910 he was associated with the London School of Economics. From 1914 to 1918 Dr. Malinowski was a member of the Robert Mond Expedition to New Guinea and North Melanesia, and it was the research done on this expedition that was later published in Argonauts of the Western Pacific.

It's a phrase that people like you and I often utter as natural response when we hear a problem from a friend or loved one. This expression, however, is far more than lip service or kind words of comfort. Instead, packed inside this deceivingly simple phrase, there is a direct line to an all-loving, all-powerful God. <p>In Christian Prayer For Dummies, I explore how prayer is God's "x-factor" for Christians to transform their lives in today&#x2019;s increasingly complex world. You find out that prayer is not a ritual, but a dynamic conversation with a personal God, and can be practiced in many ways and styles based on your own individual needs. You also discover how prayer can bring your family, small group, and church closer together and mend torn relationships. In the heart of the book, I candidly look at the basic questions &#x2014; why, when, and how to pray &#x2014; as well as some of the toughest issues that prayer has to offer, such as: </p><p>* How can you reconcile "thy will be done" with "ask and you shall receive"? <br>* Why does a loving God not always answer your prayers in a manner you expect? <br>* What can you do when you disagree with God&#x2019;s answer? <br>* How can you discern God&#x2019;s voice when you pray? <br>* Does God heal in today&#x2019;s world? </p><p>Throughout the book, my aim is to avoid the two extremes - "touchy-feely" spiritualism and heavy theological prose - that you can so often encounter when reading about prayer. Instead, I aspire to touch a middle ground that is easy reading yet packed with substance, highly practical yet life changing.</p>Richard Wagner is founder and writer of Digitalwalk.net (www.digitalwalk.net), a Web-based commentary with the purpose of challenging and encouraging Christians to earnestly live out their faith in a digital, postmodern world.

When one of these friends married in 1843, Mary Ann took over from his wife the task of translating D.F. Strauss&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Life of Jesus Critically Examined&nbsp;</i>(1846), a work that had deep effect on English rationalism. After her father&#x2019;s death she settled in London and from 1851 to 1854 she served as a writer and editor of the&nbsp;<i>Westminster Review</i>, the organ of the Radical party. In London she met she met George Henry Lewes, a journalist and advanced thinker. Lewes was separated from his wife, who had had two sons by another man, but had been unable to obtain a divorce. In a step daring for Victorian times, Mary Ann Evans began living openly with Lewes in 1854, in a union they both considered as sacred as a legal marriage and one that lasted until his death in 1878.<br><br>With Lewes&#x2019;s encouragement, Mary Ann Evans wrote her first fictional work, &#x201c;The Sad Fortunes of the Reverend Amos Barton,&#x201d; for&nbsp;<i>Blackwood&#x2019;s Magazine</i>&nbsp;in 1857; it was followed by two more stories published under the pseudonym George Elliot&#x2013;&#x201c;George&#x201d; because it was Lewes&#x2019;s name and &#x201c;Eliot&#x201d; because, she said, it was good mouth-filling, easily pronounced word.&#x201d; At the age of thirty-nine she used her memories of Warwickshire to write her first long novel,&nbsp;<i>Adam Bede&nbsp;</i>(1859), a book that established her as the foremost woman novelist in her day. Then came&nbsp;<i>The Mill on the Floss&nbsp;</i>(1860),&nbsp;<i>Silas Marner&nbsp;</i>(1861), and&nbsp;<i>Romola</i>&nbsp;(1863). Her masterpiece and one of the greatest English novels,&nbsp;<i>Middlemarch</i>, was published in 1871-72. Her last work was&nbsp;<i>Daniel Deronda</i>&nbsp;(1876). After Lewes&#x2019;s death George Eliot married John Walter Cross. He was forty; she was sixty-one. Before her death on December 22, 1880, she had been recognized by her contemporaries as the greatest living writer of English fiction.</p><h2>Oliver Twist (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p><em>Oliver Twist</em> is a classic tale of a boy of unknown parentage born in a workhouse and brought up under the cruel conditions to which pauper children were exposed in the Victorian England. With this novel, Dickens did not merely write a topical satire on the workhouse system and the role of the 1834 New Poor Law in fostering criminality. He created a moral fable about the survival of good, a romance, and a gripping story in which he exploited suspense and violence more effectively than any of his contemporaries. The new Oxford World's Classics edition of <em>Oliver Twist</em> is based on the authoritative Clarendon edition, which uses Dickens's revised text of 1846. It includes his preface of 1841 in which he defended himself against hostile criticism, and includes all twenty-four original illustrations by George Cruikshank. Stephen Gill's groundbreaking introduction gives a fascinating new account of the novel. He also provides appendices on Dickens and Cruikshank, on Dickens's Preface and the Newgate Novel Controversy, on <em>Oliver Twist</em> and the New Poor Law, and on thieves' slang.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years<strong> Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

A former KGB officer who had access to the most sensitive Soviet intelligence. He describes in detail his life as a member of the KGB and his defection to the West. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>The suspenseful, eye-opening memoir of a Soviet spy who came in from the cold. Writing in the third person, Sheymov offers a riveting account of his upwardly mobile career with the KGB and the factors that led him to defect to the West in 1980. In 1969, after graduating with an engineering degreee from Moscow's prestigious Technical University, the author joined a Defense Ministry institute that was researching military uses of space. Recruited by the state's intelligence service in 1971, at age 25, Sheymov eventually became the Eighth Chief Directorate's principal troubleshooter. In this sensitive capacity, he traveled far afield, ensuring the security of enciphered KGB communications throughout the world: During one sojourn, for example, he was able to figure out how the technologically backward Chinese had managed to eavesdrop on the USSR's Beijing embassy. Along the way, the author also learned about his agency's penetration of the Russian Orthodox Church, its role in the plot to assassinate Pope John-Paul II, and its involvement in other unsavory projects. But the higher Sheymov climbed, the more disillusioned he became with Communism and the Kremlin elite's corruption. Resolved to inflict as much damage as he could on the system, the author, while on a Warsaw assignment, evaded his minder and made contact with the CIA. The latter third of the narrative provides a detailed briefing on how Sheymov's knowledge of KGB tradecraft, as well as the professionalism of US operatives, allowed him to slip across two closely guarded borders into Austria with his wife and young daughter. The exfiltration was so skillfully executed that the author's erstwhile masters long believed that he and his family were dead. While the story ends abruptly with Sheymov's escorted arrival in N.Y.C., it seems likely that the information he subsequently furnished American officials hastened the cold war's end. A top-level insider's dramatic, stranger-than-fiction disclosures in the great game of espionage. (Maps and photographs- -not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Sheymov was a senior manager and troubleshooter in the communications division of the KGB, a position affording him a comprehensive overview of the organization. In this suspenseful third-person narrative, he reveals how he was recruited and trained, gives details of his most interesting assignments and describes the gradual disillusionment that led to his defection. How, in 1980, the CIA smuggled him out of the Soviet Union with his wife and five-year-old daughter into the United States forms the core of this exciting story. The KGB, fooled into thinking Sheymov was dead, did not learn of his defection for 10 years. The KGB, he maintains, has not been disbanded, but, rather, has increased operations under President Boris Yeltsin. Sheymov became a U.S. citizen in 1985 and works as a business consultant.

Former UN official and BBC correspondent Edward Hooper hopes to find the source of AIDS in <i>The River</i>, a stunningly comprehensive yet deeply engaging scientific history of the disease. Through more than 10 years of research comprising over 600 interviews and untold hours of library work, Hooper has uncovered a complex, interlocking set of stories--of scientific research, of medical assistance to the Third World, of political and economic exigencies that drive the courses of our lives--and brought them together in over 1,000 pages of text, footnotes, references, and illustrations.<p> His thesis, that HIV made the jump from simians to humans via the administration of oral polio vaccine in Africa in the 1950s, is still controversial, but his arguments are powerful, broad, and undeniable--all that is lacking is conclusive proof. Like a good scientist (and, sad to say, unlike any HIV researcher to date), he offers several easy tests of his hypothesis. His tales of brilliant epidemiological deductions, biochemical comparisons, and physiological insights ought to convince the medical establishment that the answer can and should be found, both to help us deal with the current crisis and to keep us from creating new ones of its ilk. In a litigation-weary world, though, it seems that it will take the kind of tireless, impartial research found in <i>The River</i> to show us--and our leaders--that blame should take a back seat to truth when extreme circumstances demand it. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Based on over a decade of research, involving more than 600 interviews and analysis of more than 4,000 scientific texts, The River examines the myriad theories about the origin of the AIDS epidemic--and reaches a stunning and startling conclusion. <p>Since the early nineties, serious HW researchers have been aware that the most common variant of HIV--human immunodeficiency virus--is the direct descendant of an SIV--simian immunodeficiency virus--carried by African chimpanzees. This still leaves, however, the important and puzzling question of how the virus jumped from chimps to humans, which is all the more intriguing because scientists believe that the SIV has existed harmlessly in chimps for thousands of years, but transferred to humans in the middle of the twentieth century. </p><p>At the end of the century, most informed observers believe that only two viable explanations remain for how this might have happened. </p><p>Many doctors and scientists think the transfer was "natural," the result of human/chimp encounters--either from the keeping of chimps as pets, or from hunting and skinning chimps for food. That AIDS appeared only recently is due, they argue, to the massive social changes in Africa over the last few decades, including the large migrations that occurred after World War II and the end of European control of Africa. </p><p>Others, including Edward Hooper, believe it more likely that the transfer was the result of American and European medical interventions in Africa during the 1950s--and specifically the administration of more than a million doses of an experimental oral polio vaccine, some batches of which may have been manufactured from chimp kidneys. Hooper's extensive investigations and interviews in America, Europe, and Africa lead to some remarkable revelations, which include previously unpublished details about where the vaccines were given and the locations of the earliest traces of HIV and AIDS, as revealed by archival blood and tissue samples. The maps of vaccinations and early AIDS cases are extraordinarily similar. </p><p>At the heart of this book is a riveting detective story with frightening implications--including the continued reluctance of the medical and scientific communities to properly investigate the hypothesis that their activities may have inadvertently given birth to the most devastating infectious disease in human history.</p></p><h2>The Harvester (Library of Indiana Classics)</h2><p><p>Gene Stratton-Porter returns us to her beloved Midwestern woodlands with a hero modeled after Henry David Thoreau.

Her parents were Southern Presbyterian missionaries, most often stationed in China, and from childhood, Pearl spoke both English and Chinese. She returned to China shortly after graduation from Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia, in 1914, and the following year, she met a young agricultural economist named John Lossing Buck. They married in 1917, and immediately moved to Nanhsuchou in rural Anhwei province. In this impoverished community, Pearl Buck gathered the material that she would later use in <i>The Good Earth</i> and other stories of China.<p>Pearl began to publish stories and essays in the 1920s, in magazines such as <i>The Nation, The Chinese Recorder, Asia,</i> and <i>The Atlantic Monthly.</i> Her first novel, <i>East Wind, West Wind,</i> was published by the John Day Company in 1930. John Day's publisher, Richard Walsh, would eventually become Pearl's second husband, in 1935, after both received divorces.</p><p>In 1931, John Day published Pearl's second novel, <i>The Good Earth.</i> This became the bestselling book of both 1931 and 1932, won the Pulitzer Prize and the Howells Medal in 1935, and would be adapted as a major MGM film in 1937. Other novels and books of nonfiction quickly followed. In 1938, less than a decade after her first book had appeared, Pearl won the Nobel Prize in literature, the first American woman to do so. By the time of her death in 1973, Pearl had published more than seventy books: novels, collections of stories, biography and autobiography, poetry, drama, children's literature, and translations from the Chinese. She is buried at Green Hills Farm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.</p><p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> It was Wang Lung's marriage day. At first, opening his eyes in the blackness of the curtains about his bed, he could not think why the dawn seemed different from any other. The house was still except for the faint, gasping cough of his old father, whose room was opposite to his own across the middle room. Every morning the old man's cough was the first sound to be heard. Wang Lung usually lay listening to it and moved only when he heard it approaching nearer and when he heard the door of his father's room squeak upon its wooden hinges. </p><p> But this morning he did not wait. He sprang up and pushed aside the curtains of his bed. It was a dark, ruddy dawn, and through a small square hole of a window, where the tattered paper fluttered, a glimpse of bronze sky gleamed. He went to the hole and tore the paper away. </p><p> "It is spring and I do not need this," he muttered. </p><p> He was ashamed to say aloud that he wished the house to look neat on this day. The hole was barely large enough to admit his hand and he thrust it out to feel of the air. A small soft wind blew gently from the east, a wind mild and murmurous and full of rain. It was a good omen. The fields needed rain for fruition. There would be no rain this day, but within a few days, if this wind continued, there would be water. It was good. Yesterday he had said to his father that if this brazen, glittering sunshine continued, the wheat could not fill in the ear. Now it was as if Heaven had chosen this day to wish him well. Earth would bear fruit. </p><p> He hurried out into the middle room, drawing on his blue outer trousers as he went, and knotting about the fullness at his waist his girdle of blue cotton cloth. He left his upper body bare until he had heated water to bathe himself. He went into the shed which was the kitchen, leaning against the house, and out of its dusk an ox twisted its head from behind the corner next the door and lowed at him deeply. The kitchen was made of earthen bricks as the house was, great squares of earth dug from their own fields, and thatched with straw from their own wheat. Out of their own earth had his grandfather in his youth fashioned also the oven, baked and black with many years of meal preparing. On top of this earthen structure stood a deep, round, iron cauldron. </p><p> This cauldron he filled partly full of water, dipping it with a half gourd from an earthen jar that stood near, but he dipped cautiously, for water was precious. Then, after a hesitation, he suddenly lifted the jar and emptied all the water into the cauldron. This day he would bathe his whole body. Not since he was a child upon his mother's knee had anyone looked upon his body. Today one would, and he would have it clean. </p><p> He went around the oven to the rear, and selecting a handful of the dry grass and stalks standing in the corner of the kitchen, he arranged it delicately in the mouth of the oven, making the most of every leaf. Then from an old flint and iron he caught a flame and thrust it into the straw and there was a blaze. </p><p> This was the last morning he would have to light the fire. He had lit it every morning since his mother died six years before. He had lit the fire, boiled water, and poured the water into a bowl and taken it into the room where his father sat upon his bed, coughing and fumbling for his shoes upon the floor. Every morning for these six years the old man had waited for his son to bring in hot water to ease him of his morning coughing. Now father and son could rest. There was a woman coming to the house. Never again would Wang Lung have to rise summer and winter at dawn to light the fire. He could lie in his bed and wait, and he also would have a bowl of water brought to him, and if the earth were fruitful there would be tea leaves in the water. Once in some years it was so. </p><p> And if the woman wearied, there would be her children to light the fire, the many children she would bear to Wang Lung. Wang Lung stopped, struck by the thought of children running in and out of their three rooms. Three rooms had always seemed much to them, a house half empty since his mother died. They were always having to resist relatives who were more crowded -- his uncle, with his endless brood of children, coaxing. </p><p> "Now, how can two lone men need so much room? Cannot father and son sleep together? The warmth of the young one's body will comfort the old one's cough." </p><p> But the father always replied, "I am saving my bed for my grandson. He will warm my bones in my age." </p><p> Now the grandsons were coming, grandsons upon grandsons! They would have to put beds along the walls and in the middle room. The house would be full of beds. The blaze in the oven died down while Wang Lung thought of all the beds there would be in the half empty house, and the water began to chill in the cauldron. The shadowy figure of the old man appeared in the doorway, holding his unbuttoned garments about him. He was coughing and spitting and he gasped. </p><p> "How is it that there is not water yet to heat my lungs?" </p><p> Wang Lung stared and recalled himself and was ashamed. </p><p> "This fuel is damp," he muttered from behind the stove. </p><p> "The damp wind -- " </p><p> The old man continued to cough perseveringly and would not cease until the water boiled. Wang Lung dipped some into a bowl, and then, after a moment, he opened a glazed jar that stood upon a ledge of the stove and took from it a dozen or so of the curled dried leaves and sprinkled them upon the surface of the water. The old man's eyes opened greedily and immediately he began to complain. </p><p> "Why are you wasteful? Tea is like eating silver." </p><p> "It is the day," replied Wang Lung with a short laugh. "Eat and be comforted." </p><p> The old man grasped the bowl in his shriveled, knotty fingers, muttering, uttering little grunts. He watched the leaves uncurl and spread upon the surface of the water, unable to bear drinking the precious stuff. </p><p> "It will be cold," said Wang Lung. </p><p> "True -- true -- " said the old man in alarm, and he began to take great gulps of the hot tea. He passed into an animal satisfaction, like a child fixed upon its feeding. But he was not too forgetful to see Wang Lung dipping the water recklessly from the cauldron into a deep wooden tub. He lifted his head and stared at his son. </p><p> "Now there is water enough to bring a crop to fruit," he said suddenly. </p><p> Wang Lung continued to dip the water to the last drop. He did not answer. </p><p> "Now then!" cried his father loudly. </p><p> "I have not washed my body all at once since the New Year," said Wang Lung in a low voice. </p><p> He was ashamed to say to his father that he wished his body to be clean for a woman to see. He hurried out, carrying the tub to his own room. The door was hung loosely upon a warped wooden frame and it did not shut closely, and the old man tottered into the middle room and put his mouth to the opening and bawled, </p><p> "It will be ill if we start the woman like this -- tea in the morning water and all this washing!" </p><p> "It is only one day," shouted Wang Lung. And then he added, "I will throw the water on the earth when I am finished and it is not all waste." </p><p> The old man was silent at this, and Wang Lung unfastened his girdle and stepped out of his clothing. In the light that streamed in a square block from the hole he wrung a small towel from the steaming water and he scrubbed his dark slender body vigorously. Warm though he had thought the air, when his flesh was wet he was cold, and he moved quickly, passing the towel in and out of the water until from his whole body there went up a delicate cloud of steam. Then he went to a box that had been his mother's and drew from it a fresh suit of blue cotton cloth. He might be a little cold this day without the wadding of the winter garments, but he suddenly could not bear to put them on against his clean flesh. The covering of them was torn and filthy and the wadding stuck out of the holes, grey and sodden. He did not want this woman to see him for the first time with the wadding sticking out of his clothes. Later she would have to wash and mend, but not the first day. He drew over the blue cotton coat and trousers a long robe made of the same material -- his one long robe, which he wore on feast days only, ten days or so in the year, all told. Then with swift fingers he unplaited the long braid of hair that hung down his back, and taking a wooden comb from the drawer of the small, unsteady table, he began to comb out his hair. </p><p> His father drew near again and put his mouth to the crack of the door. </p><p> "Am I to have nothing to eat this day?" he complained. "At my age the bones are water in the morning until food is given them." </p><p> "I am coming," said Wang Lung, braiding his hair quickly and smoothly and weaving into the strands a tasseled, black silk cord. </p><p> Then after a moment he removed his long gown and wound his braid about his head and went out, carrying the tub of water. He had quite forgotten the breakfast. He would stir a little water into corn meal and give it to his father. For himself he could not eat. He staggered with the tub to the threshold and poured the water upon the earth nearest the door, and as he did so he remembered he had used all the water in the cauldron for his bathing and he would have to start the fire again. A wave of anger passed over him at his father. </p><p> "That old head thinks of nothing except his eating and his drinking," he muttered into the mouth of the oven; but aloud he said nothing. It was the last morning he would have to prepare food for the old man. He put a very little water into the cauldron, drawing it in a bucket from the well near the door, and it boiled quickly and he stirred meal together and took it to the old man. </p><p> "We will have rice this night, my father," he said. "Meanwhile, here is corn." </p><p> "There is only a little rice left in the basket," said the old man, seating himself at the table in the middle room and stirring with his chopsticks the thick yellow gruel. </p><p> "We will eat a little less then at the spring festival," said Wang Lung. But the old man did not hear. He was supping loudly at his bowl. </p><p> Wang Lung went into his own room then, and drew about him again the long blue robe and let down the braid of his hair. He passed his hand over his shaven brow and over his cheeks. Perhaps he had better be newly shaven? It was scarcely sunrise yet. He could pass through the Street of the Barbers and be shaved before he went to the house where the woman waited for him. If he had the money he would do it. </p><p> He took from his girdle a small greasy pouch of grey cloth and counted the money in it. There were six silver dollars and a double handful of copper coins. He had not yet told his father he had asked friends to sup that night. He had asked his male cousin, the young son of his uncle, and his uncle for his father's sake, and three neighboring farmers who lived in the village with him. He had planned to bring back from the town that morning pork, a small pond fish, and a handful of chestnuts. He might even buy a few of the bamboo sprouts from the south and a little beef to stew with the cabbage he had raised in his own garden. But this only if there were any money left after the bean oil and the soybean sauce had been bought. If he shaved his head he could not, perhaps, buy the beef. Well, he would shave his head, he decided suddenly. </p><p> He left the old man without speech and went out into the early morning. In spite of the dark red dawn the sun was mounting the horizon clouds and sparkled upon the dew on the rising wheat and barley. The farmer in Wang Lung was diverted for an instant and he stooped to examine the budding heads. They were empty as yet and waiting for the rain. He smelled the air and looked anxiously at the sky. Rain was there, dark in the clouds, heavy upon the wind. He would buy a stick of incense and place it in the little temple to the Earth God. On a day like this he would do it. </p><p> He wound his way in among the fields upon the narrow path. In the near distance the grey city wall arose. Within that gate in the wall through which he would pass stood the great house where the woman had been a slave girl since her childhood, the House of Hwang. There were those who said, "It is better to live alone than to marry a woman who has been slave in a great house." But when he had said to his father, "Am I never to have a woman?" his father replied, "With weddings costing as they do in these evil days and every woman wanting gold rings and silk clothes before she will take a man, there remain only slaves to be had for the poor." </p><p> His father had stirred himself, then, and gone to the House of Hwang and asked if there were a slave to spare. </p><p> "Not a slave too young, and above all, not a pretty one," he had said. </p><p> Wang Lung had suffered that she must not be pretty. It would be something to have a pretty wife that other men would congratulate him upon having. His father, seeing his mutinous face, had cried out at him, </p><p> "And what will we do with a pretty woman? We must have a woman who will tend the house and bear children as she works in the fields, and will a pretty woman do these things? She will be forever thinking about clothes to go with her face! No, not a pretty woman in our house. We are farmers. Moreover, who has heard of a pretty slave who was virgin in a wealthy house? All the young lords have had their fill of her. It is better to be first with an ugly woman than the hundredth with a beauty. Do you imagine a pretty woman will think your farmer's hands as pleasing as the soft hands of a rich man's son, and your sunblack face as beautiful as the golden skin of the others who have had her for their pleasure?" </p><p> Wang Lung knew his father spoke well. Nevertheless, he had to struggle with his flesh before he could answer. And then he said violently, </p><p> "At least, I will not have a woman who is pock-marked, or who has a split upper lip." </p><p> "We will have to see what is to be had," his father replied. </p><p> Well, the woman was not pock-marked nor had she a split upper lip. This much he knew, but nothing more. He and his father had bought two silver rings, washed with gold, and silver earrings, and these his father had taken to the woman's owner in acknowledgment of betrothal. Beyond this, he knew nothing of the woman who was to be his, except that on this day he could go and get her. </p><p> He walked into the cool darkness of the city gate. Water carriers, just outside, their barrows laden with great tubs of water, passed to and fro all day, the water splashing out of the tubs upon the stones. It was always wet and cool in the tunnel of the gate under the thick wall of earth and brick; cool even upon a summer's day, so that the melon vendors spread their fruits upon the stones, melons split open to drink in the moist coolness. There were none yet, for the season was too early, but baskets of small hard green peaches stood along the walls, and the vendor cried out, </p><p> "The first peaches of spring -- the first peaches! Buy, eat, purge your bowels of the poisons of winter!" </p><p> Wang Lung said to himself, </p><p> "If she likes them, I will buy her a handful when we return." ...</p></p><h2>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Barnes &amp; Noble Classics)</h2><p><i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>, by <b>Mark Twain</b>, is part of the <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i>&nbsp;series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

I do not suggest that it is his only book of permanent interest; but it is the only one in which his genius is completely realized, and the only one which creates its own category." <i>T. S. Eliot</i><p>Huckleberry Finn, rebel against school and church, casual inheritor of gold treasure, rafter of the Mississippi, and savior of Jim the runaway slave, is the archetypical American maverick.<br><br>Fleeing the respectable society that wants to "sivilize" him, Huck Finn shoves off with Jim on a rhapsodic raft journey down the Mississippi River. The two bind themselves to one another, becoming intimate friends and agreeing "there warn't no home like a raft, after all. Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a raft don't. You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft."<br><br>As Huck learns about love, responsibility, and morality, the trip becomes a metaphoric voyage through his own soul, culminating in the glorious moment when he decides to "go to hell" rather than return Jim to slavery.<br><br>Mark Twain defined classic as "a book which people praise and don't read"; Huckleberry Finn is a happy exception to his own rule. Twain's mastery of dialect, coupled with his famous wit, has made <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn </i>one of the most loved and distinctly American classics ever written.</p><p>Nominated for a Grammy for his work as co-producer of the five-CD box set <i>The Jazz Singers</i> (1998), <b>Robert O'Meally</b> is Zora Neale Hurston Professor of Literature at Columbia University and Director of Columbia University's Center for Jazz Studies.

The recent discovery of the first half of Twain's manuscript, long thought lost, made front-page news. And this unprecedented edition, which contains for the first time omitted episodes and other variations present in the first half of the handwritten manuscript, as well as facsimile reproductions of thirty manuscript pages, is indispensable to a full understanding of the novel. The changes, deletions, and additions made in the first half of the manuscript indicate that Mark Twain frequently checked his impulse to write an even darker, more confrontational book than the one he finally published.Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

Ember</b> started at Antioch College as a chemistry major. She began taking social science courses because some were required, but she soon found herself intrigued. There were lots of questions without answers, and she became excited about the possibility of a research career in social science. She spent a year in graduate school at Cornell studying sociology before continuing on to Harvard, where she studied anthropology primarily with John and Beatrice Whiting. For her Ph.D. dissertation she worked among the Luo of Kenya. While there she noticed that many boys were assigned "girls' work," such as babysitting and household chores, because their mothers (who did most of the agriculture) did not have enough girls to help out. She decided to study the possible effects of task assignment on the social behavior of boys. Using systematic behavior observations, she compared girls, boys who did a great deal of girls' work, and boys who did little such work. She found that boys assigned girls' work were intermediate in many social behaviors, compared with the other boys and girls. Later, she did cross-cultural research on variation in marriage, family, descent groups, and war and peace, mainly in collaboration with Melvin Ember, whom she married in 1970. All of these cross-cultural studies tested theories on data for worldwide samples of societies. From 1970 to 1996, she taught at Hunter College of the City University of New York. She has also served as president of the Society of Cross-Cultural Research and was one of the directors of the Summer Institutes in Comparative Anthropological Research, which were funded by the National Science Foundation. She is now executive director at the Human Relations Area Files, Inc., a nonprofit research agency at Yale University. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>After graduating from Columbia College, <b>Melvin Ember</b> went to Yale University for his Ph.D. His mentor at Yale was George Peter Murdock, an anthropologist who was instrumental in promoting cross-cultural research and building a full-text database on the cultures of the world to facilitate cross-cultural hypothesis testing. This database came to be known as the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF) because it was originally sponsored by the Institute of Human Relations at Yale. Growing in annual installments and now distributed in electronic format, the HRAF database currently covers more than 370 cultures, past and present, all over the world. He did fieldwork for his dissertation in American Samoa, where he conducted a comparison of three villages to study the effects of commercialization on political life. In addition, he did research on descent groups and how they changed with the increase of buying and selling. His cross-cultural studies focused originally on variation in marital residence and descent groups. He also conducted cross-cultural research on the relationship between economic and political development, the origin and extension of the incest taboo, the causes of polygamy, and how archaeological correlates of social customs can help draw inferences about the past. After four years of research at the National Institute of Mental Health, he taught at Antioch College and then Hunter College of the City University of New York.

Sheldon Wolin's <i>Politics and Vision</i> inspired and instructed two generations of political theorists after its appearance in 1960. This new edition retains intact the original ten chapters about political thinkers from Plato to Mill, and adds seven chapters about theorists from Marx and Nietzsche to Rawls and the postmodernists. The new chapters, which show how thinkers have grappled with the immense possibilities and dangers of modern power, are themselves a major theoretical statement. They culminate in Wolin's remarkable argument that the United States has invented a new political form, "inverted totalitarianism," in which economic rather than political power is dangerously dominant. In this new edition, the book that helped to define political theory in the late twentieth century should energize, enlighten, and provoke generations of scholars to come.</p><p> Wolin originally wrote <i>Politics and Vision</i> to challenge the idea that political analysis should consist simply of the neutral observation of objective reality. He argues that political thinkers must also rely on creative vision. Wolin shows that great theorists have been driven to shape politics to some vision of the Good that lies outside the existing political order. As he tells it, the history of theory is thus, in part, the story of changing assumptions about the Good.</p><p> In the new chapters, Wolin displays all the energy and flair, the command of detail and of grand historical developments, that he brought to this story forty years ago. This is a work of immense talent and intense thought, an intellectual achievement that will endure.</p></p><p>Winner of the 2005 David and Elaine Spitz Prize, Conference for the Study of Political Thought<p>"Sheldon Wolin is our premier contemporary theorist of engaged democracy. This expanded edition of <i>Politics and Vision</i> offers an extraordinarily comprehensive and acute account of the encounter between philosophy and political power, from classical Greece to the postmodern era of Superpower. The new edition demonstrates the power of Wolin's original enterprise by bringing it into constructive relationship with Marx, Nietzsche, and Dewey, and with political philosophy since Rawls. Essential reading for anyone concerned with the possibilities of politics in the twenty-first century."--<b>Josiah Ober, Princeton University, author of <i>The Athenian Revolution</i> and <i>Political Dissent in Democratic Athens</i></b></p><p>"In his classic work, Sheldon Wolin brings to light the most fascinating meanings of politics in its highest sense. He writes with the passion of the citizen who worries about power, and the rigor of the thinker committed to intellectual sharpness and historical awareness. In this new edition, Wolin explores in depth the most difficult challenges that our democratic ocieties are facing after their victory over totalitarianisms. Like the first edition, this new one will open fresh avenues to political thinking, and will teach us new and valuable lessons in the difficult art of being free citizens."--<b>Maurizio Viroli, Princeton University, author of <i>Niccol�'s Smile: A Biography of Machiavelli</i></b></p><p>"I am happy to report that the excitement of the great work represented by the first edition still remains, and that this book is, if anything, enhanced by the addition of the chapters on theorists including Marx, Nietzsche, Popper and Dewey, and Rawls. This revised and expanded edition is more somberly reflective than its predecessor, and at the same time more provocative in the overall picture it presents."--<b>Jeremy Waldron, Columbia Law School, author of <i>God, Locke, and Equality</i></b></p><p>"A great, provocative, intense, brilliant book. Several generations of political theorists were provoked and instructed by the original edition. Here, Sheldon Wolin brings up to date our understanding of politics and shows why earlier understandings are inadequate to contemporary developments."--<b>Tracy B.

Writing before Bhopal and Prozac entered the popular lexicon, DeLillo produced a work so closely tuned into its time that it tells the future.9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>French Made Simple: Learn to speak and understand French quickly and easily</h2><p><b><i>French Made Simple</i> will help you learn to speak French quickly and easily! </b><br><br>An invaluable introduction to one of the most studied languages, <i>French Made Simple</i> is ideal for students, business professionals, and tourists alike.

By the late 19th century, Europe, Japan, and the United States had taken control of most of the world. Travel and trade between home countries and colonies sent goods and technology to even the most remote corners of the globe. An English lady's letter home on smallpox inoculations in Turkey, an American missionary's account of the forcible collection of rubber in Belgian Congo, and a Chinese official's regulations for European merchants are among the primary sources that Bonnie Smith has assembled to demonstrate the advantages and drawbacks of the new economy. Society, education, and the environment also underwent massive changes, as witnessed by the selection of excerpts from an exam in a German missionary school in Togo and British reports on the devastation of entire forests in Burma.<br><br>Imperial growth did not come without a price. A Japanese document outlining governance in Korea and U.S. President Benjamin Harrison's defense of the annexation of Hawaii illustrate the militant nationalism, religious intolerance, and pseudo-scientific racist theories used to justify the brute force of colonial rule. The colonized nations fought back-a popular Chinese poem in praise of the Boxers' opposition to foreign rule attests to this rebellious spirit, and a Moroccan's shock at "barbaric" European mores illustrates the conquered's view of the conquerors. A picture essay, "Mixture," showcases the amalgamation of global cultures through photographs of buildings, furniture, advertisements, sporting events, and sculpture. Bonnie Smith vividly captures the booming expansion of a flawed political system and expertly links the documentary evidence with informed commentary and prefatory essays to each chapter.<br></p><p><br><strong>Bonnie G. Smith</strong> is Professor of History at Rutgers University. Her previous works include <em>Confessions of a Concierge: Madame Lucie's History of Twentieth Century France</em> (Yale UP, 1985) and <em>Changing Lives: Women in European History Since 1700</em> (D.C. Heath, 1989). She is the forthcoming general editor of the Oxford University Press young adult series The Medieval and Early Modern World, and co-author of that series' <em>Reference Volume &amp; Primary Sources</em>, coming in May 2005.<br><p>Gr 7 Up-Smith examines the "high tide" of colonial imperialism, an era characterized by the expansion of European empires in Africa and Asia for financial gain and national power. She opens with background about the racial and economic rationales for imperialism, and then provides chapters about the rapid growth of empires, the role of technology and profits in imperialism, and its impact on the environment. She also discusses how the interaction between the indigenous peoples and colonizing powers changed both of them, native resistance to the ruling powers, and the role that the two world wars played in ending imperialism. Each chapter has numerous primary-source readings, supplemented by Smith's discussion and analysis, which illustrate or expand upon the chapter topic. The primary sources reflect a wide spectrum of viewpoints. Smith is largely objective throughout, allowing the readings to carry the message of the underlying racial attitudes of the imperial powers and convey the damage their policies inflicted upon native peoples and their lands. Photos, period art, and images of artifacts supplement the text. Although this is a well-researched and comprehensive book, students will find it rather dry reading, which will limit its audience to report writers. It complements William Lace's The British Empire (Lucent, 2000), a more readable history with a more specific focus.-Mary Mueller, Rolla Junior High School, MO</p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Pictures and Tears: A History of People Who Have Cried in Front of Paintings</h2><p>Art Does art leave you cold? And is that what it&#39;s supposed to do? Or is a painting meant to move you to tears? Hemingway was reduced to tears in the midst of a drinking bout when a painting by James Thurber caught his eye. And what&#39;s bad about that? In Pictures and Tears, art historian James Elkins tells the story of paintings that have made people cry. Drawing upon anecdotes related to individual works of art, he provides a chronicle of how people have shown emotion before works of art in the past, and a meditation on the curious tearlessness with which most people approach art in the present. Deeply personal, Pictures and Tears is a history of emotion and vulnerability, and an inquiry into the nature of art. This book is a rare and invaluable treasure for people who love art. Also includes an 8-page color insert.</p><p><strong>James Elkins</strong> is Professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He is the author of many books, including <em>How to Use Your Eyes</em> and <em>What Painting Is, </em> both published by Routledge....a provocative and felicitous inquiry... the most arresting facet of his unique investigation is his charting of the declining value society places on heartfelt reactions to art... Elkins elucidates subtle conceptions of pictoral time, presence, and absence; criticizes the bloodlessness of most art-history texts; and indicts the marketplace atmosphere of most museums. Prized by Romantics in the not-so-distant past, art-inspired tears are disdained in our brittle, ironic milieu, a psychological and spiritual diminishment Elkins boldly and rightly decries.<br><b>&#x2013;Donna Seaman, <i>Booklist</i></b><br><br>To cry in front of art is not a sign of weakness: it is the flexing of a truly aesthetic power. That is the truth we gain from James Elkins' admirably engaged and engaging book.<br><b>&#x2013;Nigel Spivey, author of <i>Enduring Creation</i></b><br><br>A history of weeping, a meditation on our deepest responses to art, and an ethnography of his own tribe of art historians, <i>Pictures and Tears</i> attempts to reclaim aesthetic experience from what Elkins calls 'the poison well' of art history and theory. I wish I could have read this book before I had written my own.<br><b>&#x2013;Tom Lutz, author of <i>Crying: The Natural and Cultural History of Tears</i></b><br><br>In the course of reading this book I found the following to be especially valuable: Eileen John's questioning of traditional propositional accounts of knowledge in Art and Knowledge, Alan Goldman's defense of the much attacked concepts of aesthetic ewww.trs.nyc.ny.us.experience and attitude in The Aesthetic, and Denis Dutton's listing of characteristics of art found in all cultures in Aesthetic Universals. This is an immensely useful book that belongs in every college library and on the bookshelves of all serious students of aesthetics.

Here are all the phantoms and ghouls of Japanese folklore: "rokuro-kubi," whose heads separate from their bodies at night; "jikininki," or flesh-eating goblins; and terrifying faceless "mujina" who haunt lonely neighborhoods. Lafcadio Hearn, a master storyteller, drew on traditional Japanese folklore, infused with memories of his own haunted childhood in Ireland, to create the chilling tales in <i>Japanese Ghost Stories</i>. They are today regarded in Japan as classics in their own right.</p><p>The improbable life story of <b>Lafcadio Hearn</b> (1850&#x2013;1904) included a peculiarly gothic childhood in Ireland during which he was successively abandoned by his mother, his father and his guardian; two decades in New Orleans, where he worked as a journalist and was sacked for marrying a former slave; and a long period in Japan, where he became a Buddhist, married a Japanese woman and wrote about ju-jitsu and Japanese aesthetics for a Western readership. His ghost stories, which were drawn from Japanese folklore, appeared in collections throughout the 1890s.

Proverbial wisdom is certainly correct in the case of <i>Policy Studies for Educational Leaders: An Introduction.</i> The idea for this book was born in the summer of 1990 when, new Ph.D. in hand, I was invited to teach a graduate course in education policy at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville. After discovering no suitable textbooks, I ordered a few paperbacks on current issues and put together a course packet consisting of articles on various aspects of education policy. Although my students were bright and motivated, I often felt frustrated; none had taken a college course in political science and few had been involved in the policy process at any level. I found, therefore, that I had to devote much class time to filling in the gaps in their knowledge. Often I longed for a good textbook that would provide basic information, freeing up precious class time for substantive discussions of policy issues. </p> <p> That fall I began a new position at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where one of my responsibilities was a graduate course in education policy. As I worked with my students over the next few years, my earlier feelings were reinforced. The lack of a good, basic text hampered my teaching in various ways. Thus, the idea for this book was born. As I revised and restructured the course during those years, I also gathered materials for a future textbook, developing an organizational structure and a series of learning materials for students. </p> <p><b><i>TEXT PHILOSOPHY AND FOCUS</i></b></p> <p> <i>Policy Studies for Educational Leaders: An Introduction</i> is based on the following set of beliefs: </p> <ol> <li><i>Educational leaders need to be literate about policy and the policy process.</i> The time is long past (if indeed there ever was a time) when education administrators could tell themselves that "Politics and education don't mix" and sit complacently on the sidelines while others make important policy decisions for the schools. In today's rapidly changing policy environment, those who lead our schools <i>must</i> have a basic understanding of education policy and how it is made. Otherwise, they will be reactive rather than proactive; and, when they move into action, they are likely to make serious blunders.</li> <li><i>Educational leaders need both theories and practical information about education policy and policy making.</i> Unfortunately, many people in education believe that theory and practice are unrelated and; indeed, opposites. I reject this view. If school administrators are truly to be reflective leaders, they need tools for thinking, deeply and critically, about education policy. Among these necessary tools are knowledge about major research findings, analytical frameworks, and important political theories. However, people who are politically inexperienced also need practical advice about how to apply this abstract information. Therefore, this book presents both the underlying theories and specific recommendations for practice.</li> <li><i>Educational leaders need to understand power and how to use it responsibly.</i> The underlying theory behind this book is conflict theory&#x2014;the belief that policy grows out of conflict between different individuals, groups, and institutions. Since the outcome of these struggles is shaped by the balance of power among the participants, students must understand power. Conflict theory is a large theoretical house, ranging from the pluralists who focus on the dynamics of practical politics to scholars whose thinking has been influenced by Marx and Gramsci, with many stops in between. Unfortunately, education scholars in the United States tend to set up a binary opposition between the pluralists and more "critical" thinkers, focusing on either practical politics or cultural politics to the exclusion of the other. In my opinion, these approaches are neither theoretically adequate nor pedagogically sound, leading either to'students who understand day-to-day politics (but ignore the more subtle play of power that shapes most social injustice) or to students who have a good grasp of how powerful cultural institutions shape consciousness (but do not know what happens in a legislature or court). My book transcends this unfortunate dichotomy by using Oxford University professor Steven Lukes' (1974) integration of pluralist and "critical" perspectives with studies of the mobilization of bias to yield a holistic theory which encompasses the many faces of power. Thus, instructors can teach their students about <i>both</i> the dynamics of everyday American power politics <i>and</i> how powerful interests use institutions and culture to perpetuate injustices based on race, gender, and class.</li> <li><i>All public policy, but especially education policy, is value laden.</i> In political science, one school of policy analysis seeks to conduct "value-free" analysis. In my opinion, their work is misleading because it is based on a fundamental misconception about social reality. I agree, therefore, with those political scientists who consider policy making to be inherently intertwined with values. This book reflects that belief. Not only is an entire chapter devoted to policy values and ideology, but throughout the book I raise issues of values. Because many of the conflicts in which school leaders become embroiled turn on questions of deeply held values, this emphasis lays the foundation for a good understanding of where and when struggles over values are most likely to arise.</li> <li><i>State government has become increasingly important in the last 25 years and will probably continue to be so.</i> In the United States, education policy is developed at four levels: federal, state, district, and school. Although this book touches on all four levels, it emphasizes the state level. Not only is this level growing in importance, but it is the least understood for several reasons: the federal focus of most civics and government courses, the split national-local focus of the media, and the patterns of practical experience that most educators develop during their careers. Therefore, filling this gap seemed essential.</li> </ol> <p><b>TEXT ORGANIZATION</b></p> <p> This book is divided into twelve chapters, which can be grouped in the following four categories: </p> <ol> <li><i>Introductory chapters</i> (Chapters 1 and 2). The first two chapters lay a general foundation for students, most of whom have never taken a basic political science course. Chapter 1 presents an overview of education policy and the policy process. Chapter 2 deals with power, presenting Lukes' theory in detail, and applying it both to day-to-day politics and the more subtle power mechanisms, which maintain inequalities based on race, class, and gender. It also provides an introduction to discursive analysis.<i>The policy environment</i> (Chapters 3-5). As a social phenomenon, policy grows out of a specific socioeconomic context. Chapters 3, 4, and S provide background for students about the most important dimensions of this context: economics, demographics, political structures, political culture, values, and ideology.</li> <li><i>The policy process</i> (Chapters 6-11). Students can understand education policy&#x2014;and how to influence it&#x2014;only if they understand how it is developed, implemented, and assessed. Chapters 6 through 11 focus on this process, using the classical stage model. Chapter 6 introduces the major policy players, and the following chapters show them in action as policy issues are defined, moved onto the policy agenda, formulated, adopted, implemented, and evaluated.</li> <li><i>Retrospective and prospective</i> (Chapter 12). This chapter seeks to provide students&#x2014;who should now have a much more sophisticated understanding of education policy than they did when they started the book&#x2014;with an historical framework for understanding the current education reform movement.</li> </ol> <p><b>SPECIAL FEATURES</b></p> <p> I have tried to make this book as user friendly as possible for both students and professors. To that end, I have provided the following special features: </p> <ol> <li><i>Focus questions.</i> Each chapter opens with several questions that relate to the major content of the chapter. These questions serve as advance organizers for students, helping them identify the most important points as they read.</li> <li><i>Figures and tables.</i> The figures and tables in this book summarize important points that would be tedious in paragraph form, give a visible form to theoretical material for visual learners, and provide an easy reference for the most important principles of political action.</li> <li><i>End-of-chapter activities.</i> Every chapter (except Chapters 9 and 12) ends with at least four of these five types of learning activities for homework or class discussion: Questions and Activities for Discussion, a case study, a news story for analysis, a pro-con debate, and an Internet assignment. These activities can also be used as the basis for short papers.</li> <li><i>For further reading.</i> Each chapter, except Chapter 9, ends with a short, annotated bibliography of books and articles on the topic covered in that chapter that students and professors can use to extend and deepen the material in the chapter.</li> </ol> <p><b>NEW TO THIS EDITION</b></p> <p> Much has happened since I prepared the final manuscript of the first edition in 1998: the technology revolution has continued unabated, a new census has been taken, the booming 1990s economy has faltered, the United States has experienced one of the most closely contested presidential elections of its history, and terrorist attacks on New York and Washington have led to a threat of war abroad and an unprecedented state of alert at home. In education policy, both school choice and standards-based reform have flourished; and concerns about the achievement gap related to race and class have grown. Therefore, numerous changes were needed for this second edition. I will briefly describe them below. </p> <ol> <li><i>Demographic and economic information has been up...</i></li></ol></p><h2>Creative Teaching Press Phonemic Awareness Book</h2><p>Experts are raving about this &#34;must-have&#34; resource for primary teachers that includes dozens of fun activities to help children listen to language and play with sounds.

The goods were kept in a secure room under constant scrutiny, deep inside a crowded building with guards at the exits. The team picked for the job included two old hands known only as Paul and Swede, but all depended on a fresh face, a kid from Pinetown, North Carolina. In the Depression, some fellows were willing to try anything -- even a heist in the rare book room of the New York Public Library.<br><br>In <em>Thieves of Book Row,</em> Travis McDade tells the gripping tale of the worst book-theft ring in American history, and the intrepid detective who brought it down. Author of <em>The Book Thief</em> and a curator of rare books, McDade transforms painstaking research into a rich portrait of Manhattan's Book Row in the 1920s and '30s, where organized crime met America's cultural treasures in dark and crowded shops along gritty Fourth Avenue. Dealers such as Harry Gold, a tough native of the Lower East Side, became experts in recognizing the value of books and recruiting a pool of thieves to steal them -- many of them unemployed men who drifted up the Bowery or huddled around fires in Central Park's shantytowns. When Paul and Swede brought a new recruit into his shop, Gold trained him for the biggest score yet: a first edition of Edgar Allan Poe's <em>Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems.</em> Gold's recruit cased the rare-book room for weeks, searching for a weakness. When he found one, he struck, leading to a breathtaking game of wits between Gold and NYPL special investigator G.

Just such a mind-expanding premise inspired this landmark book, developed from the acclaimed "Walk Through Time" exhibit on tour around the world.<br> <br> Here, in one lavish volume, is the remarkable drama of the history of the universe and life on Earth. Travel from the furious blast of the Big Bang to the first pulse of life, and on through the rich pageant of life's evolution from primordial microbes to the rise of Homo sapiens. Span 15 billion years to discover life's greatest mysteries emerging. Over 130 beautiful four-color illustrations and an absorbing narrative highlight significant events and themes in Earth's life story. The original exhibit itself is re-created as a timeline that runs throughout the book, pinpointing key stages in the evolutionary drama and where they fall in the vast sweep of time.<br> <br> One result is a new appreciation of the rich complexity of the life processes of the planet aeons before the appearance of large-scale plants and animals. On the mile-long scale of the original "Walk," for example, microbial life appears 4,000 feet in the past and remains the sole life-form for most of the mile. Humans appear merely three feet ago. The last ice age concludes only one-tenth of an inch in the past, and the world's population currently doubles each half a thousandth of an inch.<br> <br> By relating life's story according to the accurate timeline of evolution, A Walk Through Time highlights just what latecomers we humans are to Earth's family of life, and showcases the surprising ingenuity and stamina of the microbial life that preceded us and still supports the life all around us. The book also reveals the stunning effects the human species has wrought in so short a span of time, precipitating what may become the largest species extinction in 65 million years.<br> <br> All along the way, we are informed of the most important recent discoveries. We explore the exuberant creativity of microbial life-forms and learn about their surprisingly cosmopolitan lives, interconnected in a teeming web of symbiotic relationships described as the first World Wide Web of information exchange. We learn about the many mysteries being unraveled as we probe the code of DNA; how the universe coalesced into galaxies and planets; and how microscopic animals can survive in such superheated environments as deep-sea vents and deep inside the Earth. Most importantly, we learn that we can no longer perceive Earth as an inert lump of rock with an assembly of different life-forms, but must understand that our planet comprises one comprehensive, intricately woven life system.<br> <br> Those who take this walk through time will gain a new understanding of the wondrous history of how life developed, a feeling of awe and inspiration for the complexity and beauty of the processes that have made life possible over billions of years, and a greater appreciation for the growing impact the human species is having on the future of all the myriad forms of life, including our own.<br> <br> Imagine taking a walk where every step transports you a few million years through time! A Walk Through Time takes you on just such a journey. In addition to the informative main text, which tells the lively story of the evolution of life, the book contains the original text and illustrations of the acclaimed "Walk Through Time" exhibition on tour around the world. This innovative exhibition tells the story of life's evolution in a mile-long walk highlighting the major developments.<br> <br> In the book, the text of the exhibition runs along the bottom of the pages, along with a timeline to show how many millions of years have passed. Beautifully written and lavishly illustrated, A Walk Through Time allows you to both savor the astonishing story of life's evolution through the engaging narrative of the main text and to enjoy the exhibition in the comfort of your own home.</p><p>Every step you take in <i>A Walk Through Time</i> moves you millions of years forward in Earth's history. Inspired by the idea of a one-mile stroll through the evolution of life, Sidney Liebes recruited some terrific writers and artists to create a traveling museum exhibit; <i>A Walk Through Time</i> summarizes the experience in book form, with the help of fascinating photos and intelligent, enjoyable text. The most profound realization along this temporal journey is just how small a part human history plays in the big time line. In the museum exhibit, where one foot equals one million years, human presence takes up all of one-thousandth of an inch; in the book's time line, we merit barely a speck. Our tiniest living fellows--the bacteria and blue-green algae, the amazing arthropods, the merging microbes--are the real stars of the show. Readers are treated to intriguing views of bizarre organisms like tardigrades, velvet worms, and lichens ("Taking everything we know about algae and fungi, we still never would have predicted the outcome of their synergy"), along with the microbes that once ruled the earth. Only at the very end of the line, long after the development of sexual reproduction, after the great Cretaceous extinction, after the development of flight and fur, will you find humans. Taking this walk is a great lesson in perspective, a cautionary tale about hubris and longevity that every human should read. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>SIDNEY LIEBES, Ph.D., is a physicist with research and teaching careers at Princeton and Stanford Universities.

Alice's encounters with the White Rabbit, the Cheshire-Cat, the Queen of Hearts, the Mad Hatter, and many other extraordinary characters have made them beloved by children. Yet they also appeal to adults fascinated by the many layers of satire, allusion, and symbolism about Victorian culture and politics. <br><br>This new edition explores the phenomenal range of reference and the paradoxical appeal of two of the most inventive books in world literature. The volume has been deftly edited by one of the foremost children's literature experts, Peter Hunt, and it features the original, much-loved illustrations by Sir John Tenniel, newly scanned and reset for enhanced sharpness and clarity. Extensive explanatory notes give information on Carroll's political, social, intellectual, and personal allusions and sources. The book provides an extensive bibliography and a chronology of Carroll's life and times, and it also includes a deleted episode called "The Wasp in a Wig."<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

When she's not traipsing after a rabbit into Wonderland, she's gallivanting off into the topsy-turvy world behind the drawing-room looking glass. In <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>, Lewis Carroll's masterful and zany sequel to <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, she makes more eccentric acquaintances, including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the White Queen, and a somewhat grumpy Humpty Dumpty. Through a giant and elaborate chess game, Alice explores this odd country, where one must eat dry biscuits to quench thirst, and run like the wind to stay in one place. As in life, Alice must stay on her toes to learn the rules of this game. <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> immediately took its rightful place beside its partner on the shelf of eternal classics. And luckily for generations of enraptured children, Carroll was again able to persuade John Tenniel to create the fantastic woodblock engravings that have become so indelibly associated with the Alice stories. For almost 130 years, Alice's curious adventures have amused, perplexed, and delighted readers, young and old. This gorgeous, deluxe boxed set of both volumes contains engravings from Tenniel's original woodblocks that were discovered in a London bank in 1985, and reproduced for the first time here. "'What is the use of a book,' thought Alice, 'without pictures?'" What indeed? (All ages)Founded in 1906 by J.M.

By extracting the fundamental concepts from this enormous and ever-growing field, the authors tell the story of cell biology, and create a coherent framework through which non-expert readers may approach the subject. Written in clear and concise language, and beautifully illustrated, the book is enjoyable to read, and it provides a clear sense of the excitement of modern biology. <i>Molecular Biology of the Cell</i> sets forth the current understanding of cell biology (completely updated as of Autumn 2001), and it explores the intriguing implications and possibilities of the great deal that remains unknown.<br>The hallmark features of previous editions continue in the Fourth Edition. The book is designed with a clean and open, single-column layout. The art program maintains a completely consistent format and style, and includes over 1,600 photographs, electron micrographs, and original drawings by the authors. Clear and concise concept headings introduce each section. Every chapter contains extensive references. Most important, every chapter has been subjected to a rigorous, collaborative revision process where, in addition to incorporating comments from expert reviewers, each co-author reads and reviews the other authors' prose. The result is a truly integrated work with a single authorial voice.</p></p><p><p>"In an era when we are drowning in information, the job of a textbook such as Molecular Biology of the Cell is to help teach its readers how to swim.

At first glance, it doesn't seem possible that the authors had to decide what details to leave out. It looks as if they'd covered it all. From a basic discussion of cells, genomes, and cell chemistry to DNA, cellular organization, function and cell immunity, the authors have incorporated facts, specific examples, and essential concepts in a way that makes this new edition a landmark work in the field of molecular cell biology. As genomics expands more rapidly than anyone thought possible, and complete sequencing of genomes from bacteria to humans has revolutionized our understanding of living things, new information is critical. Included in this amazing text are discussions of new discoveries in biotechnology, cellular mechanisms, infection and immunity. Without sacrificing content, the authors have put together a remarkable book that can be used for courses in cell biology or molecular biology (chapters 1 through 8). Outstanding drawings, photographs, and diagrams fill the chapters to enhance the excellent writing. Every instructor will want to keep a reference copy on his or her shelf, whether they use the book for their classes or not. As a textbook, there's not one better.

The facts of his life, known from surviving documents, are sparse. He was one of eight children born to John Shakespeare, a merchant of some standing in his community. William probably went to the King&#x2019;s New School in Stratford, but he had no university education. In November 1582, at the age of eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway, eight years his senior, who was pregnant with their first child, Susanna. She was born on May 26, 1583. Twins, a boy, Hamnet ( who would die at age eleven), and a girl, Judith, were born in 1585. By 1592 Shakespeare had gone to London working as an actor and already known as a playwright. A rival dramatist, Robert Greene, referred to him as &#x201c;an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers.&#x201d; Shakespeare became a principal shareholder and playwright of the successful acting troupe, the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men (later under James I, called the King&#x2019; s Men). In 1599 the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men built and occupied the Globe Theater in Southwark near the Thames River. Here many of Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays were performed by the most famous actors of his time, including Richard Burbage, Will Kempe, and Robert Armin. In addition to his 37 plays, Shakespeare had a hand in others, including&nbsp;<i>Sir Thomas More</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, and he wrote poems, including&nbsp;<i>Venus and Adonis</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Rape of Lucrece</i>. His 154 sonnets were published, probably without his authorization, in 1609. In 1611 or 1612 he gave up his lodgings in London and devoted more and more time to retirement in Stratford, though he continued writing such plays as&nbsp;<i>The Tempest</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Henry VII&nbsp;</i>until about 1613. He died on April 23, 1616, and was buried in Holy Trinity Church, Stratford. No collected edition of his plays was published during his life-time, but in 1623 two members of his acting company, John Heminges and Henry Condell, put together the great collection now called the First Folio.&#x201c;Shakespeare has deliberately opened up the �two-�character form he inherited and, as the dramatist he would become, populated the �love-�sequence in new and drastically more interesting ways . . . In inventive metaphorical reach alone, Shakespeare excels his predecessors . . . [He] makes the �sonnet-�voice ampler and more psychologically convincing than ever before.&#x201d; &#x2013;from the Introduction by Helen Vendler</p><h2>Reading Wonders Reading/Writing Workshop Volume 2 Grade K (ELEMENTARY CORE READING)</h2><p>Mcgraw-hill Reading Wonders Ccss Reading/ Language Arts Program Unit 2</p><p>McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>More Catholic Tales for Boys and Girls</h2><p><p>Here are stories of princes and gypsies, bishops and bears tales of Catholic boys and girls that remind us that especially in young souls the Faith is quite strong, and evil is never a match for goodness.</p> <p>Among others, you'll meet:</p> <ul> <li>Bernard, the boy who walks three miles to Mass and meets Christ on his way; </li><li>Nickie, the young prince who learns from a dancing bear a strong lesson in love; </li><li>Tommy, who uses kindness and two minnows to heal a bishop and save a school; </li><li>Osbert and Rupert, gypsy twins who make a donkey of themselves to bring peace to the world; </li><li>Joey, the stable boy whose coat is transformed when his donkey bears Jesus to Jerusalem; and </li><li>Kathleen, who goes without candy and brings a shopkeeper back to the Faith.</li></ul> <p>Soviet cows, Marian icons, pet mice, Easter roosters, Noah and the ark, fish, donkeys, and even a dinosaur: they're all here in a dozen charming tales of children living their Faith while having great Catholic fun.</p></p><p>Caryll Houselander (1901-1954) was an artist and the author of more than fifteen books for adults and children.

Unwilling to marry without both love and money, Lily becomes vulnerable to the kind of gossip and slander which attach to a girl who has been on the marriage market for too long. Wharton charts the course of Lily&#39;s life, providing, along the way, a wider picture of a society in transition, a rapidly changing New York where the old certainties of manners, morals and family have disappeared and the individual has become an expendable commodity.</p><p>"The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth," warns Ecclesiastes 7:4, and so does the novel by Edith Wharton that takes its title from this call to heed. New York at the turn of the century was a time of opulence and frivolity for those who could afford it. But for those who couldn't and yet wanted desperately to keep up with the whirlwind, like Wharton's charming Lily Bart, it was something else altogether: a gilded cage rather than the Gilded Age. <p> One of Wharton's earliest descriptions of her heroine, in the library of her bachelor friend and sometime suitor Lawrence Selden, indicates that she appears "as though she were a captured dryad subdued to the conventions of the drawing room." Indeed, herein lies Lily's problem. She has, we're told, "been brought up to be ornamental," and yet her spirit is larger than what this ancillary role requires. By today's standards she would be nothing more than a mild rebel, but in the era into which Wharton drops her unmercifully, this tiny spark of character, combined with numerous assaults by vicious society women and bad luck, ultimately renders Lily persona non grata. Her own ambivalence about her position serves to open the door to disaster: several times she is on the verge of "good" marriage and squanders it at the last moment, unwilling to play by the rules of a society that produces, as she calls them, "poor, miserable, marriageable girls.</p><p> Lily's rather violent tumble down the social ladder provides a thumbnail sketch of the general injustices of the upper classes (which, incidentally, Wharton never quite manages to condemn entirely, clearly believing that such life is cruel but without alternative). From her start as a beautiful woman at the height of her powers to her sad finale as a recently fired milliner's assistant addicted to sleeping drugs, Lily Bart is heroic, not least for her final admission of her own role in her downfall. "Once--twice--you gave me the chance to escape from my life and I refused it: refused it because I was a coward," she tells Selden as the book draws to a close. All manner of hideous socialite beasts--some of whose treatment by Wharton, such as the token social-climbing Jew, Simon Rosedale, date the book unfortunately--wander through the novel while Lily plummets. As her tale winds down to nothing more than the remnants of social grace and cold hard cash, it's hard not to agree with Lily's own assessment of herself: "I have tried hard--but life is difficult, and I am a very useless person. I can hardly be said to have an independent existence. I was just a screw or a cog in the great machine I called life, and when I dropped out of it I found I was of no use anywhere else." Nevertheless, it's even harder not to believe that she deserved better, which is why <i>The House of Mirth</i> remains so timely and so vital in spite of its crushing end and its unflattering portrait of what life offers up. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>PHP for the Web: Visual QuickStart Guide</h2><p><b>Learn PHP programming the quick and easy way!</b> <br> With <b>PHP for the Web: Visual QuickStart Guide</b>&nbsp;readers can start from the beginning to get a tour of the programming language, or look up specific tasks to learn just what they need to know.&nbsp; <br> This task-based visual reference guide uses step-by-step instructions and plenty of screenshots to teach beginning and intermediate users this popular open-source scripting language.

The global economy requires a new set of leadership skills-imbued with a global mindset, multi-functional and effective across cultures and nationalities-that were not as critical even a decade ago. <br><br>In <i>What Is Global Leadership?, </i>the authors draw on cutting-edge research conducted by Aperian Global, including first-hand interviews with successful global leaders, which highlights ten key behaviors critical to international settings, such as cultural self-awareness, frame-shifting, and developing "third-way solutions." <br><br>In addition to providing a detailed description of each behavior, the authors demonstrate how these can be applied in the context of leadership development programs, executive coaching, global teams, and leader-led action learning. Whether one is leading an entire organization, a business unit, or a geographically dispersed team, this essential guide provides an important resource for developing global leadership talent.</p><p>Ernest Gundling is co-founder and co-President of Aperian Global and author of Working GlobeSmart and co-author of Global Diversity.

Extreme diversity of outcomes among otherwise powerful players�??banks, companies, investors, and even countries�??is hard to explain any other way. This volume provides an authoritative, engaging and readable primer on global leadership to help explain the past and gain a sharper perspective on the future.<br><br>Well done!

It binds us to our neighbors and tells us who we are. But increasingly -- from the United States to India, from Russia to Burma -- nationalism is being invoked for unworthy ends: to disdain minorities or to support despots. As a result, nationalism has become to many a dirty word.<br>In <i>Give Me Liberty</i>, award-winning historian and biographer Richard Brookhiser offers up a truer and more inspiring story of American nationalism as it has evolved over four hundred years. He examines America's history through thirteen documents that made the United States a new country in a new world: a free country. We are what we are because of them; we stay true to what we are by staying true to them.<br>Americans have always sought liberty, asked for it, fought for it; every victory has been the fulfillment of old hopes and promises. This is our nationalism, and we should be proud of it.<br></p><p><b>Richard Brookhiser</b> is a senior editor of <i>National Review</i> and the author of thirteen books, including <i>John Marshall: The Man Who Made the Supreme Court</i>, <i>Founders' Son: A Life of Abraham Lincoln</i>, and<i> James Madison</i>.

In his signature style, he wastes no words, defies the conventional political categories, and invites us to join him in recovering a series of inspirational moments when we all felt the same future in our hearts and minds."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Joseph J. Ellis, author of <i>American Dialogue: The Founders and Us</i></b></i></b><br><br>"With his characteristic combination of elegance and shrewdness, Richard Brookhiser gives us another insightful account of what makes us the nation we are. <i>Give Me Liberty</i> is intellectual history at its riveting best."&#x2015;<b>H.W.

Appeals to the wisdom of nature are among the most powerful arguments in the history of human thought. Yet Nature (with a capital N) and natural goodness are not objective or scientific. In this groundbreaking book, scholar of religion Alan Levinovitz demonstrates that these beliefs are actually religious and highlights the many dangers of substituting simple myths for complicated realities. It may not seem like a problem when it comes to paying a premium for organic food. But what about condemnations of "unnatural" sexual activity? The guilt that attends not having a "natural" birth? Economic deregulation justified by the inherent goodness of "natural" markets?<br><br>In <i>Natural,</i> readers embark on an epic journey, from Peruvian rainforests to the backcountry in Yellowstone Park, from a "natural" bodybuilding competition to a "natural" cancer-curing clinic. The result is an essential new perspective that shatters faith in Nature's goodness and points to a better alternative. We can love nature without worshipping it, and we can work toward a better world with humility and dialogue rather than taboos and zealotry.</p><p><b>Alan Levinovitz</b> is associate professor of religious studies at James Madison University.

It includes poetry and prose by today&#39;s best and most well-known writers.</p><p><b>Deirdre Mullane</b> is a publicist, editor, publisher, agent, author, and founder of Mullane Literary Associates. She is the editor of <i>Crossing the Danger Water</i> and <i>Words to Make My Dream Children Live</i>.Anthologies tend to be either literary or historical, but this substantial volume combines many forms of writing in an effort to mirror the African American experience in its entirety. The opening document is the personal narrative of one of the first Africans to arrive on the American continent, Olaudah Equiano, a scout and interpreter in the employ of Spanish explorers from 1527 to 1539. Early government papers record such events as the emancipation of slaves for military service during the American Revolution, while slave revolts are described in vivid letters written by rebels. The varied and expressive selections, introduced by informative editorial commentary, follow the course of history up through the Civil War, Reconstruction, the founding of the NAACP, and on into the civil-rights movement, the Vietnam War, and even the L.A. riots. Editorials from early African American newspapers are reprinted as are court opinions, song lyrics, and folktales. Essays, poems, and speeches by Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, Booker T. Washington, W .E. B. Du Bois, Gwendolyn Brooks, Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, Jesse Jackson, and Alice Walker are some of the collection's highlights. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>William Tecumseh Sherman: In the Service of My Country: A Life</h2><p><p><strong>A major new biography of one of America&#x2019;s most storied military figures.</strong></p> General Sherman&#x2019;s 1864 burning of Atlanta solidified his legacy as a ruthless leader. Yet Sherman proved far more complex than his legendary military tactics reveal. James Lee McDonough offers fresh insight into a man tormented by the fear that history would pass him by, who was plagued by personal debts, and who lived much of his life separated from his family. As a soldier, Sherman evolved from a spirited student at West Point into a general who steered the Civil War&#x2019;s most decisive campaigns, rendered here in graphic detail. Lamenting casualties, Sherman sought the war&#x2019;s swift end by devastating Southern resources in the Carolinas and on his famous March to the Sea. This meticulously researched biography explores Sherman&#x2019;s warm friendship with Ulysses S. Grant, his strained relationship with his wife, Ellen, and his unassuageable grief over the death of his young son, Willy. The result is a remarkable, comprehensive life of an American icon whose legacy resonates to this day. 8 pages of illustrations, 10 maps</p><p>James Lee McDonough is a Civil War historian and the author of nine books, including Nashville: The Western Confederacy&#x2019;s Final Gamble.

Dub is a sub-genre of Jamaican reggae that flourished during reggae's "golden age" of the late 1960s through the early 1980s. Dub involves remixing existing recordings&#x2015;electronically improvising sound effects and altering vocal tracks&#x2015;to create its unique sound. Just as hip-hop turned phonograph turntables into musical instruments, dub turned the mixing and sound processing technologies of the recording studio into instruments of composition and real-time improvisation. In addition to chronicling dub's development and offering the first thorough analysis of the music itself, author Michael Veal examines dub's social significance in Jamaican culture. He further explores the "dub revolution" that has crossed musical and cultural boundaries for over thirty years, influencing a wide variety of musical genres around the globe.</p><p>MICHAEL VEAL is associate professor of ethnomusicology at Yale University, where he specializes in ethnomusicology and African-American music. He is the author of Fela: The Life and Times of an African Musical Icon (2000)."Veal has written the first comprehensive overview of (dub's) development up to and including the digital music that followed dub's analog innovations... Veal does an excellent job of explaining, analyzing, and describing sounds. He also connects dub's influence to hip-hop, dance, electronica, and other modern genres, demonstrating how many dub tricks are still being used today in various incarnations. Readers will especially appreciate Veal's excellent Appendix of Recommended Listening, which includes catalog numbers that will make these recordings easier to find... (T)his is certainly the best and only book on dub music; highly recommended for all academic and public music collections where reggae music is popular."&#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i><p>"This extraordinary book, with its rich interpretation of the aesthetics and social significance of dub, constitutes a dramatically original contribution to the study of Jamaican popular music, and should be a landmark in popular music studies as a whole."&#x2015;Peter Manuel, professor of ethnomusicology, John Jay College and CUNY Graduate Center</p><p>"Veal's wise volume has rescued Reggae music at last from the tentacles of exoticism. This is a glorious affirmation of dub's rebel, Creole spirit."&#x2015;Paul Gilroy, Anthony Giddens professor of social theory, London School of Economics</p><p>"Veal has written the first comprehensive overview of (dub's) development up to and including the digital music that followed dub's analog innovations...

Where Veal's book steals a march on the competition is in his technical analysis of how Tubby, Perry, Thompson, Sylvan Morris, and other mixing engineers adapted (and creatively abused) the equipment in studios... He also analyzes a number of tracks by each of the principal dub engineers under discussion...to show the transformation of song to version and dub, all of which is illuminating...(H)e provides valuable information as to where these tracks may be found...

They&#x2019;ve turned gray! I think she&#x2019;s trying to poison me. My husband insists they&#x2019;re fine but I don&#x2019;t believe him. What if they&#x2019;re in cahoots? Is it normal for chocolate to turn gray?</p><p>&#x2014;Suspicious in Graysville, Tennessee</p><p>Dear Suspicious,</p><p>It&#x2019;s so common that it has a name. The powdery gray on your chocolates is called a bloom. It&#x2019;s caused by moisture and often happens when chocolates are stored in the refrigerator. Chocolates with a bloom are perfectly fine to eat but not very attractive.</p><p>&#x2014;Sophie</p><p>The first box of chocolates arrived on a Monday. I assumed they were a gift from Joe Merano, the chairman of Amore Chocolates, because I was working on events for the sixtieth anniversary of his company. But the bold red box wasn&#x2019;t embossed with the Amore logo of entwined gold hearts. Nor was there a card. It had simply been left at my front door.</p><p>A second box arrived on Tuesday and another on Wednesday.</p><p>On Thursday morning, Nina Reid Norwood, my across-the-street neighbor and best friend, discovered another box at my front door. She now stared at the four open boxes on my kitchen table. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re like perfect little brown gems. Handmade, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Definitely.&#x201d; In each box, six chocolates nestled on crimped white papers. No two chocolates were alike.</p><p>Nina&#x2019;s fingers hovered, rotating in the air above them. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t eaten any.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Get your greedy little hand away. I don&#x2019;t know who or where they came from.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But they&#x2019;re so beautiful. You have to try one! They&#x2019;re probably filled with something rich and creamy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You are <i>not</i> eating any until we know who left them at my door.&#x201d;</p><p>Nina signed with exasperation. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure they&#x2019;re from Alex.&#x201d;</p><p>I had been dating Alex German for a while. When he was in town, anyway. &#x201c;I phoned Alex to thank him. He didn&#x2019;t know a thing about them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mars, then.&#x201d;</p><p>I shook my head. They weren&#x2019;t from my ex-husband, either.</p><p>A grin spread across Nina&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;You have an admirer!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly.&#x201d; The notion <i>had</i> crossed my mind, though. Chocolates hinted at romance, didn&#x2019;t they? But if nothing else, I was a realist. &#x201c;More likely they&#x2019;re some kind of promotional effort in connection with the opening of C�l�bration de Chocolat.&#x201d; Arnaud Turn�be, the famous Belgian chocolatier, had chosen Old Town as the location for his first American shop. Until now, his exquisite chocolates had been available only by special order, flown in fresh from Belgium at considerable cost. I was looking forward to actually trying one of them.</p><p>Nina frowned and picked up a lid to examine it. &#x201c;What kind of promotion doesn&#x2019;t mention the name of the business?&#x201d;</p><p>The doorknocker sounded. I headed to the foyer and opened the front door.</p><p>Coco Ross rushed inside, breathless. &#x201c;I hope you don&#x2019;t mind my stopping by.&#x201d; A well-known socialite, Coco had been my contact at the company for the anniversary events. I guessed her to be about fifty but she had the energy of a much younger woman. Coco laughed easily, and her expressive, dark brown eyes didn&#x2019;t hide her emotions. &#x201c;This is Nonni.&#x201d;</p><p>A tiny woman dressed all in blue followed Coco at a slower pace, aided by a cane. Her white hair was pinned up in a tidy bun. Not a speck of makeup touched her face. She couldn&#x2019;t have weighed more than ninety pounds.</p><p>I shook Nonni&#x2019;s frail hand. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a pleasure to meet you, Nonni. Won&#x2019;t you come in and have a seat?&#x201d;</p><p>They followed me into my kitchen, where Coco greeted Nina and introduced Nonni.</p><p>&#x201c;I am going to strangle Natasha,&#x201d; announced Coco.</p><p>Leaning against the center island, Nina said, &#x201c;Get in line.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, seriously. I&#x2019;m beginning to worry about myself.&#x201d; Coco flapped the neckline of her pink and green Lilly Pulitzer dress as though she thought the air would cool her. &#x201c;Really. I lie in bed at night, thinking of ways to knock her off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Could I offer you iced tea or lemonade?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>Coco responded, &#x201c;Iced tea, please. It&#x2019;s hotter than blazes outside.&#x201d; She lifted the back of her neatly bobbed hair off her neck and fanned herself.</p><p>Nonni sat down in an armchair by the fireplace.</p><p>&#x201c;Natasha entered ten recipes in our contest. We rejected them all. Correction. <i>I</i> rejected them all.&#x201d; Coco pressed the heel of her hand against her forehead briefly. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t <i>know</i> they were from her. They were atrocious. Who wants to eat a chocolate dill cream roll? Now she&#x2019;s offended and seeking revenge by bad-mouthing Amore.&#x201d;</p><p>I filled tall glasses with ice cubes and poured the iced tea.</p><p>Happily, I spotted a leftover strawberry tart hiding behind the red peppers. Chocolate coated the bottom, and I had drizzled more chocolate on top of the strawberries, as well. The chocolate ought to please Coco and Nonni.</p><p>I placed slices on four square white plates and added a generous dollop of whipped cream to each.</p><p>Nonni sat in a chair by the fireplace watching me. My Ocicat, Mochie, nestled on her lap. I delivered a drink and slice of the tart to the table for her.</p><p>Nonni smiled at me. &#x201c;I like you kitchen.&#x201d;</p><p>She spoke with a thick Italian accent and pronounced <i>kitchen</i> as <i>keetchen</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;</p><p>She waggled a gnarled forefinger at me. &#x201c;I know everything about you when I see you keetchen. Is clean, is warm. You like you keetchen, too.&#x201d;</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t help smiling. Judging a person by her kitchen was a new one to me. &#x201c;Yes, I do like it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sofia is good Italian name. You are Italian?&#x201d;</p><p>I hedged. We definitely weren&#x2019;t Italian. &#x201c;My family came from Europe.&#x201d;</p><p>That seemed to satisfy her. &#x201c;We have problem in family. You will help us.&#x201d; With the aid of her walking stick, she rose to her feet and tottered to my kitchen table, where she took a seat.</p><p>I brought drinks and slices of the tart for the rest of us and set them on the cool fern green tablecloth, along with forks and rose-colored napkins.</p><p>&#x201c;All is settled,&#x201d; said Nonni. &#x201c;Sofia will help us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At the risk of upsetting everyone, I haven&#x2019;t agreed to anything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, yes,&#x201d; insisted Nonni. &#x201c;You help. Now I eat.&#x201d;</p><p>Coco licked her lips nervously. She appeared too agitated to sit down. Coco and her brother, Dan, were the heirs to Amore Chocolates. The sixtieth anniversary events weren&#x2019;t the biggest projects I had ever put together, but they had certainly been different. Amore Chocolates was best known for delicious boxed chocolates, but they also made fabulous, yet lesser-known, cooking chocolate, both powdered and in squares. They had sponsored a contest for home cooks and were bringing the creators of the winning recipes to Old Town for a huge tasting in the gorgeous garden of Joe&#x2019;s home. The recipes had been included in a new Amore Chocolates cookbook.</p><p>Coco handled marketing for Amore. Gregarious and outgoing, she was the perfect person to represent the company. In fact, she had told me she would be taking over most of the outings planned for the winners. I suspected she wanted to be along to schmooze when they were on TV and participated in various contests and demonstrations around metropolitan Washington, DC. It was fine with me. I arranged the tasting, the farewell dinner, lodging, and transportation. The rest was up to her.</p><p>Coco chugged her iced tea and refilled her glass. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand Natasha. She&#x2019;s so lovely and perfect on her TV show that I thought she was a smart businesswoman.&#x201d; She gazed at the tart for a moment. &#x201c;I had no idea that she&#x2019;s an egocentric, bullheaded&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2014;nincompoop.&#x201d; Nonni ended the sentence for her.</p><p>Nina slid into the banquette and listened while she sampled the tart.</p><p>I placed the pitcher of iced tea on the table, and Coco finally settled into a chair.</p><p>I joined them.</p><p>Lowering her voice, Coco continued, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s really not much that doesn&#x2019;t work with chocolate. Nuts, spices, fruit, even chicken. But who wants to eat brownies made with bleu cheese? Now she&#x2019;s offended and seeking revenge. She&#x2019;s making it sound like we&#x2019;re snobs because the Amore tasting is by ticket only.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought that was because your dad&#x2019;s garden will only hold so many people,&#x201d; said Nina.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, <i>of course</i> that&#x2019;s the reason. We&#x2019;re not turning away the public. We&#x2019;ve been giving away tickets in contests, through radio stations, at our stores&#x2014;just everywhere! It was that or sell them but we didn&#x2019;t want to charge for our tasting celebration.&#x201d; Coco placed her forearms on the table, leaned on them, and looked at me. &#x201c;What now? She&#x2019;s making us look terrible! It&#x2019;s a public relations nightmare.&#x201d;</p><p>I had known Natasha since childhood. We grew up in the same small town and competed at everything in school. Everything except the beauty pageants she had enjoyed so much. Sometimes I was reluctant to admit it, but Natasha was a part of my life, especially since she had set up housekeeping with my ex-husband after our divorce. As though that wasn&#x2019;t bad enough, they moved into a house on my street, just a few doors down. In the divorce, neither my ex, Mars, short for Marshall, nor I had the heart to give up Daisy, our mixed-breed hound, so we split custody, and she went back and forth between us. I had to admit that living close to Mars had made that easier for us. Because the Amore events would keep me very busy, she was spending the week with Mars.</p><p>I looked into Coco&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have a word with Natasha but I&#x2019;m afraid the damage might already have been done.&#x201d;</p><p>Coco rolled her sweating iced tea glass across her forehead. &#x201c;How can it be this hot? We have to find a new venue, make more food&#x201d;&#x2014;she spoke with her hands in true Italian fashion, raising them over her head and swinging them down in a huge circle&#x2014;&#x201c;and invite the general public, no tickets necessary.&#x201d;</p><p>The words &#x201c;find a new venue&#x201d; chilled me more than any iced tea could have. I spoke gently, calmly, trying not to give away my panic. &#x201c;But the tasting is this Saturday.&#x201d; To make my point abundantly clear, I added, &#x201c;Less than three days away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Everyone says you can work magic. Surely you can find another venue.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For the last Saturday in June?&#x201d; Was she kidding? &#x201c;Brides booked Saturdays in Old Town over a year ago. And I should point out that tastings always require tickets. You have to know how many people you&#x2019;re going to serve.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Could you move it out of Old Town?&#x201d; asked Nina.</p><p>Coco gasped as though Nina had said something unimaginable. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not an option. What about the Torpedo Factory?&#x201d;</p><p>She was delusional if she thought one of the best venues in town wasn&#x2019;t booked. Once a real torpedo factory, the fabulous building now housed art galleries and artists&#x2019; studios. The atrium, main hall, and patio could be rented for private functions, but there wasn&#x2019;t a chance they would be available. &#x201c;I can make some calls.&#x201d; I said it more to soothe her than anything else. I knew I wouldn&#x2019;t find a venue in Old Town. We had hired a caterer to make the winning recipes for the party, but he would probably go ballistic if he had to produce ten times the quantity on such short notice. As gently as I could, I added, &#x201c;But don&#x2019;t hold your breath. You realize we&#x2019;re talking about moving from four hundred people to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gosh, I don&#x2019;t know how many. Four thousand?&#x201d;</p><p>Coco leaned back in her chair. &#x201c;See what you can do.&#x201d;</p><p>I was shaking my head and thinking it might be easier to bring Natasha on board in some way when Coco cried out. &#x201c;Nonni! I&#x2019;m so sorry, Sophie, she&#x2019;s used to tasting chocolates from the store.&#x201d;</p><p>Nonni held one of the mystery chocolates in her hand. Half of it was missing. &#x201c;<i>Bellissimo</i>!&#x201d;</p><p>I jumped to my feet, &#x201c;Oh, honey, don&#x2019;t eat the rest of that. I&#x2019;m sorry, I don&#x2019;t mean to be rude, but I don&#x2019;t know where they came from.&#x201d;</p><p>Nonni paid no attention whatsoever and ate the other half. &#x201c;Belgian or Swiss? Is familiar.&#x201d;</p><p>Coco stood up to take them from Nonni. But when she saw them, her eyes widened. She selected one without care, bit in, and savored it. &#x201c;Oh no,&#x201d; she moaned. But she consumed the rest of it anyway. And then she keeled over and hit the floor with a thud.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>Dear Sophie,</p><p>My neighbor asked me if I was going to temper my chocolate. I looked it up but it sounds incredibly complicated. Will my cake be ruined if I don&#x2019;t temper the chocolate first?</p><p>&#x2014;Mr. Mom in Temperance, Georgia</p><p>Dear Mr. Mom,</p><p>You don&#x2019;t need to temper chocolate when you bake with it. Tempering is generally only necessary for chocolates used to make candies. The tempering process allows them to be boxed and displayed at room temperature.</p><p>&#x2014;Sophie</p><p>&#x201c;Coco!&#x201d; I thrust her chair aside and knelt by her. &#x201c;Nina, call 911!&#x201d;</p><p>I tapped Coco&#x2019;s tanned cheeks, which were rapidly losing their color. &#x201c;Coco! Coco!&#x201d; She was still breathing.</p><p>Nonni calmly poured the remainder of her iced tea over Coco&#x2019;s face. Ice cubes skittered across the floor. For a second I worried that Coco might inhale the liquid and choke.</p><p>Coco opened her eyes and blinked. She focused on my face.</p><p>&#x201c;Coco, how do you feel?&#x201d; I asked gently.</p><p>She moaned and blinked repeatedly as though she wasn&#x2019;t quite right yet.</p><p>Outside, the siren of an ambulance drew closer.</p><p>I dabbed her wet face to dry it off. Coco tried to lift her head but the effort appeared to wear her out.</p><p>Nina opened the front door for the rescue squad.</p><p>I backed away from Coco to make room for them. Nonni seized my hand, and I gently squeezed hers in silent solidarity. One of the emergency medical technicians asked us what had happened.</p><p>Nina handed her all four of the boxes of chocolates while I explained that they had been found on my doorstep.</p><p>&#x201c;Nonni!&#x201d; I turned to her. &#x201c;Nonni ate the chocolate, too. How are you feeling?&#x201d;</p><p>Nonni patted my arm with a delicate hand. &#x201c;I am quite fine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am, too,&#x201d; Coco muttered. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need an ambulance. I just had a light-headed moment and felt dizzy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Coco! You pregnant?&#x201d; asked Nonni.</p><p>Coco snorted. &#x201c;More likely having a hot flash.&#x201d;</p><p>The EMTs encouraged he...</p></p><h2>Magic of Reality: How We Know What&#39;s Really True</h2><p>Inscribed and signed by Richard Dawkins on title page. The world&#39;s most famous evolutionary biologist, presents a gorgeously lucid, science book examining some of the nature&#39;s most fundamental questions both from a mythical and scientific perspective. 10x</p><p>Richard Dawkins is the former Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University (1995-2008).

That sounds straightforward, doesn&#x2019;t it? Actually, it isn&#x2019;t. There are various problems. What about dinosaurs, which once existed but exist no longer? What about stars, which are so far away that, by the time their light reaches us and we can see them, they may have fizzled out?<br> <br>We&#x2019;ll come to dinosaurs and stars in a moment. But in any case, how do we know things exist, even in the present? Well, our five senses &#x2013; sight, smell, touch, hearing and taste &#x2013; do a pretty good job of convincing us that many things are real: rocks and camels, newly mown grass and freshly ground coffee, sandpaper and velvet, waterfalls and doorbells, sugar and salt. But are we only going to call something &#x2018;real&#x2019; if we can detect it directly with one of our five senses?<br> <br>What about a distant galaxy, too far away to be seen with the naked eye? What about a bacterium, too small to be seen without a powerful microscope? Must we say that these do not exist because we can&#x2019;t see them? No. Obviously we can enhance our senses through the use of special instruments: telescopes for the galaxy, microscopes for bacteria. Because we understand telescopes and microscopes, and how they work, we can use them to extend the reach of our senses &#x2013; in this case, the sense of sight &#x2013; and what they enable us to see convinces us that galaxies and bacteria exist.<br> <br>How about radio waves? Do they exist? Our eyes can&#x2019;t detect them, nor can our ears, but again special instruments &#x2013; television sets, for example &#x2013; convert them into signals that we can see and hear. So, although we can&#x2019;t see or hear radio waves, we know they are a part of reality. As with telescopes and microscopes, we understand how radios and televisions work. So they help our senses to build a picture of what exists: the real world &#x2013; reality. Radio telescopes (and X-ray telescopes) show us stars and galaxies through what seem like different eyes: another way to expand our view of reality.<br> <br>Back to those dinosaurs. How do we know that they once roamed the Earth? We have never seen them or heard them or had to run away from them. Alas, we don&#x2019;t have a time machine to show them to us directly. But here we have a different kind of aid to our senses: we have fossils, and we can see <i>them</i> with the naked eye. Fossils don&#x2019;t run and jump but, because we understand how fossils are formed, they can tell us something of what happened millions of years ago. We understand how water, with minerals dissolved in it, seeps into corpses buried in layers of mud and rock. We understand how the minerals crystallize out of the water and replace the materials of the corpse, atom by atom, leaving some trace of the original animal&#x2019;s form imprinted on the stone. So, although we can&#x2019;t see dinosaurs directly with our senses, we can work out that they must have existed, using indirect evidence that still ultimately reaches us through our senses: we see and touch the stony traces of ancient life.<br> <br>In a different sense, a telescope can work like a kind of time machine. What we see when we look at anything is actually light, and light takes time to travel. Even when you look at a friend&#x2019;s face you are seeing them in the past, because the light from their face takes a tiny fraction of a second to travel to your eye. Sound travels much more slowly, which is why you see a firework burst in the sky noticeably earlier than you hear the bang. When you watch a man chopping down a tree in the distance, there is an odd delay in the sound of his axe hitting the tree.<br> <br>Light travels so fast that we normally assume anything we see happens at the instant we see it. But stars are another matter. Even the sun is eight light-minutes away. If the sun blew up, this catastrophic event wouldn&#x2019;t become a part of our reality until eight minutes later. And that would be the end of us! As for the next nearest star, Proxima Centauri, if you look at it in 2012, what you are seeing is happening in 2008. Galaxies are huge collections of stars. We are in one galaxy called the Milky Way. When you look at the Milky Way&#x2019;s next-door neighbour, the Andromeda galaxy, your telescope is a time machine taking you back two and a half million years. There&#x2019;s a cluster of five galaxies called Stephan&#x2019;s Quintet, which we see through the Hubble telescope spectacularly colliding with each other. But we see them colliding 280 million years ago. If there are aliens in one of those colliding galaxies with a telescope powerful enough to see us, what they are seeing on Earth, at this very moment, here and now, is the early ancestors of the dinosaurs.<br> <br>Are there really aliens in outer space? We&#x2019;ve never seen or heard them. Are they a part of reality? Nobody knows; but we do know what kind of things could one day tell us if they are. If ever we got near to an alien, our sense organs could tell us about it. Perhaps somebody will one day invent a telescope powerful enough to detect life on other planets from here. Or perhaps our radio telescopes will pick up messages that could only have come from an alien intelligence. For reality doesn&#x2019;t just consist of the things we already know about: it also includes things that exist but that we don&#x2019;t know about yet and won&#x2019;t know about until some future time, perhaps when we have built better instruments to assist our five senses.<br> <br>Atoms have always existed, but it was only rather recently that we became sure of their existence, and it is likely that our descendants will know about many more things that, for now, we do not. That is the wonder and the joy of science: it goes on and on uncovering new things. This doesn&#x2019;t mean we should believe just <i>anything</i> that anybody might dream up: there are a million things we can imagine but which are highly unlikely to be real &#x2013; fairies and hobgoblins, leprechauns and hippogriffs. We should always be open-minded, but the only good reason to believe that something exists is if there is real evidence that it does.<br> <br><b>Models: testing our imagination</b><br> <br>There is a less familiar way in which a scientist can work out what is real when our five senses cannot detect it directly. This is through the use of a &#x2018;model&#x2019; of what <i>might</i> be going on, which can then be tested. We imagine &#x2013; you might say we guess &#x2013; what might be there. That is called the model. We then work out (often by doing a mathematical calculation) what we ought to see, or hear, etc. (often with the help of measuring instruments) if the model were true. We then check whether that is what we actually do see. The model might literally be a replica made out of wood or plastic, or it might be a piece of mathematics on paper, or it might be a <i>simulation</i> in a computer. We look carefully at the model and <i>predict</i> what we ought to see or hear, etc. if the model were correct. Then we look to see whether the predictions are right or wrong. If they are right, this increases our confidence that the model really does represent reality; we then go on to devise further experiments, perhaps refining the model, to test the findings further and confirm them. If our predictions are wrong, we reject the model, or modify it and try again.<br> <br>Here&#x2019;s an example. Nowadays, we know that genes &#x2013; the units of heredity &#x2013; are made of stuff called DNA. We know a great deal about DNA and how it works. But you can&#x2019;t see the details of what DNA looks like, even with a powerful microscope. Almost everything we know about DNA comes indirectly from dreaming up models and then testing them.<br> <br>Actually, long before anyone had even heard of DNA, scientists already knew lots about genes from testing the predictions of models. Back in the nineteenth century, an Austrian monk called Gregor Mendel did experiments in his monastery garden, breeding peas in large quantities. He counted the numbers of plants that had flowers of various colours, or that had peas that were wrinkly or smooth, as the generations went by. Mendel never saw or touched a gene. All he saw were peas and flowers, and he could use his eyes to <i>count</i> different types. He invented a <i>model</i>, which involved what we would now call genes (though Mendel didn&#x2019;t call them that), and he calculated that, if his model were correct, in a particular breeding experiment there ought to be three times as many smooth peas as wrinkly ones. And that is what he found when he counted them. Leaving aside the details, the point is that Mendel&#x2019;s &#x2018;genes&#x2019; were an invention of his imagination: he couldn&#x2019;t see them with his eyes, not even with a microscope. But he could see smooth and wrinkled peas, and by counting them he found indirect evidence that his <i>model</i> of heredity was a good representation of something in the real world. Later scientists used a modification of Mendel&#x2019;s method, working with other living things such as fruit flies instead of peas, to show that genes are strung out in a definite order, along threads called chromosomes (we humans have forty-six chromosomes, fruit flies have eight). It was even possible to work out, by testing models, the exact order in which genes were arranged along chromosomes. All this was done long before we knew that genes were made of DNA.<br> <br>Nowadays we know this, and we know exactly how DNA works, thanks to James Watson and Francis Crick, plus a lot of other scientists who came after them. Watson and Crick could not see DNA with their own eyes. Once again, they made their discoveries by imagining models and testing them. In their case, they literally built metal and cardboard models of what DNA might look like, and they calculated what certain measurements ought to be if those models were correct. The predictions of one model, the so-called double helix model, exactly fitted the measurements made by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, using special instruments involving X-rays beamed into crystals of purified DNA. Watson and Crick also immediately realized that their model of the structure of DNA would produce exactly the kind of results seen by Gregor Mendel in his monastery garden.<br> <br>We come to know what is real, then, in one of three ways. We can detect it directly, using our five senses; or indirectly, using our senses aided by special instruments such as telescopes and microscopes; or even more indirectly, by creating models of what <i>might</i> be real and then testing those models to see whether they successfully predict things that we can see (or hear, etc.), with or without the aid of instruments. Ultimately, it always comes back to our senses, one way or another.<br> <br>Does this mean that reality only contains things that can be detected, directly or indirectly, by our senses and by the methods of science? What about things like jealousy and joy, happiness and love? Are these not also real?<br> <br>Yes, they are real. But they depend for their existence on brains: human brains, certainly, and probably the brains of other advanced animal species, such as chimpanzees, dogs and whales, too. Rocks don&#x2019;t feel joy or jealousy, and mountains do not love. These emotions are intensely real to those who experience them, but they didn&#x2019;t exist before brains did. It is possible that emotions like these &#x2013; and perhaps other emotions that we can&#x2019;t begin to dream of &#x2013; could exist on other planets, but only if those planets also contain brains &#x2013; or something equivalent to brains: for who knows what weird thinking organs or feeling machines may lurk elsewhere in the universe?<br> <br><b>Science and the supernatural: explanation and its enemy</b><br> <br>So that is reality, and that is how we can know whether something is real or not. Each chapter of this book is going to be about one particular aspect of reality &#x2013; the sun, for instance, or earthquakes, or rainbows, or the many different kinds of animals. I want now to turn to the other key word of my title: magic. Magic is a slippery word: it is commonly used in three different ways, and the first thing I must do is distinguish between them. I&#x2019;ll call the first one &#x2018;supernatural magic&#x2019;, the second one &#x2018;stage magic&#x2019; and the third one (which is my favourite meaning, and the one I intend in my title) &#x2018;poetic magic&#x2019;.<br> <br>Supernatural magic is the kind of magic we find in myths and fairy tales. (In &#x2018;miracles&#x2019;, too, though I shall leave those to one side for now and return to them in the final chapter.) It&#x2019;s the magic of Aladdin&#x2019;s lamp, of wizards&#x2019; spells, of the Brothers Grimm, of Hans Christian Andersen and of J. K. Rowling. It&#x2019;s the fictional magic of a witch casting a spell and turning a prince into a frog, or a fairy godmother changing a pumpkin into a gleaming coach. These are the stories we all remember with fondness from our childhood, and many of us still enjoy when served up in a traditional Christmas pantomime &#x2013; but we all know this kind of magic is just fiction and does not happen in reality.<br> <br>Stage magic, by contrast, really does happen, and it can be great fun. Or at least, <i>something</i> really happens, though it isn&#x2019;t what the audience thinks it is. A man on a stage (it usually is a man, for some reason) deceives us into thinking that something astonishing has happened (it may even <i>seem</i> supernatural) when what really happened was something quite different. Silk handkerchiefs cannot turn into rabbits, any more than frogs can turn into princes. What we have seen on the stage is only a trick. Our eyes have deceived us &#x2013; or rather, the conjuror has gone to great pains to deceive our eyes, perhaps by cleverly using words to distract us from what he is really doing with his hands.<br> <br>Some conjurors are honest and go out of their way to make sure their audiences know that they have simply performed a trick. I am thinking of people like James &#x2018;The Amazing&#x2019; Randi, or Penn and Teller, or Derren Brown. Even though these admirable performers don&#x2019;t usually tell the audience exactly <i>how</i> they did the trick &#x2013; they could be thrown out of the Magic Circle (the conjurors&#x2019; club) if they did that &#x2013; they do make sure the audience knows that there was no supernatural magic involved. Others don&#x2019;t actively spell out that it was just a trick, but they don&#x2019;t make exaggerated claims about what they have done either &#x2013; they just leave the audience with the rather enjoyable sensation that something mysterious has happened, without actively lying about it. But unfortunately there are some conjurors who are deliberately dishonest, and who pretend they really do have &#x2018;supernatural&#x2019; or &#x2018;paranormal&#x2019; powers: perhaps they claim that they really can bend metal or stop clocks by the power of thought alone. Some of these dishonest fakes (&#x2018;charlatans&#x2019; is a good word for them) earn large fees from mining or oil companies by claiming that they can tell, using &#x2018;psychic powers&#x2019;, where would be a good place to drill. Other charlatans exploit people who are grieving, by claiming to be able to make contact with the dead. When this happens it is no longer just fun or entertainment, but preying on people&#x2019;s gullibility and distress. To be fair, it may be that not all of these people are charlatans. Some of them may sincerely believe they are talking to the dead.<br> <br>The third meaning of magic is the one I mean in my title: poetic magic. We are moved to tears by a beautiful piece of music and we describe the performance as &#x2018;magical&#x2019;. We gaze up at the stars on a dark night with no moon and no city lights and, breathless with joy, we say the sight is &#x2018;pure magic&#x2019;. We might use the same word to describe a gorgeous sunset, or an alpine landscape, or a rainbow against a dark sky. In this sense, &#x2018;magical&#x2019; simply means deeply moving, exhilarating: something that gives us goose bumps, something that makes us feel more fully alive. What I hope to show you in this book is that reality &#x2013; the facts of the real wo...</p><h2>Archaeologies of the Future: The Desire Called Utopia and Other Science Fictions</h2><p>In an age of globalization characterized by the dizzying technologies of the First World, and the social disintegration of the Third, is the concept of utopia still meaningful? <i>Archaeologies of the Future</i>, Jameson&#x2019;s most substantial work since <i>Postmodernism, Or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism</i>, investigates the development of this form since Thomas More, and interrogates the functions of utopian thinking in a post-Communist age.

Her father told her she wouldn't be able to go: "In a few months' time we should probably all find ourselves in the Workhouse!" he opined. Brittain had hoped to escape the Northern provinces, but the war seemingly dashed her plans. "It is not, perhaps, so very surprising that the War at first seemed to me an infuriating personal interruption rather than a world-wide catastrophe." <p> Her father eventually relented, however, and she was allowed to attend. By the end of her first year, she had fallen in love with a young soldier and resolved to become active in the war effort by volunteering as a nurse--turning her back on what she called her "provincial young-ladyhood." Brittain suffered through 12-hour days by reminding herself that nothing she endured was worse than what her fianc�, Roland, experienced in the trenches. Roland was expected home on leave for Christmas 1915; on December 26, Brittain received news that he had been killed at the front. Ten months later Brittain herself was sent to Malta and then to France to serve in the hospitals nearer the front, where she witnessed firsthand the horrors of battle. When peace finally came, Brittain had also lost her brother Edward and two close friends. As she walked the streets of London on November 11, 1918--Armistice Day--she felt alone in the crowds:</p><p> </p><blockquote> For the first time I realised, with all that full realisation meant, how completely everything that had hitherto made up my life had vanished with Edward and Roland, with Victor and Geoffrey. The War was over; a new age was beginning; but the dead were dead and would never return. </blockquote><p> First published in 1933, <i>Testament of Youth</i> established Brittain as one of the best-loved authors of her time. Her crisp, clear prose and searing honesty make this unsentimental memoir of a generation scarred by war a classic. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p>Born in 1893, Vera Brittain won an exhibition to Somerville College, Oxford, in 1914, but a year later abandoned her studies to enlist as a VAD nurse. She served throughout the war, working in London, Malta and close to the Front in France. At the end of the war, with all of those closest to her dead, she returned to Oxford.<br><br>Vera Brittain was a convinced pacifist, a prolific speaker, lecturer, journalist and writer, she devoted much of her energy to the causes of peace and feminism. She wrote 29 books in all, novels, poetry, biography and autobiography, but it was TESTAMENT OF YOUTH which established her reputation and made her one of the best-loved writers of her time. She died in 1970.</p><h2>Short Lessons in Art History: Exercises and Activities</h2><p>A novel way to engage art or art history students.

Historian Daniel R. Headrick ranges from the Stone Age and the beginnings of agriculture to the Industrial Revolution and the electronic revolution of the recent past. In tracing the growing power of humans over nature through increasingly powerful innovations, he compares the evolution of technology in different parts of the world, providing a much broader account than is found in other histories of technology. We also discover how small changes sometimes have dramatic results--how, for instance, the stirrup revolutionized war and gave the Mongols a deadly advantage over the Chinese. And how the nailed horseshoe was a pivotal breakthrough for western farmers. Enlivened with many illustrations, <em>Technology</em> offers a fascinating look at the spread of inventions around the world, both as boons for humanity and as weapons of destruction.<br></p><p><br><strong>Daniel R.

But the following year, when Trump drew from the same list of candidates for his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, the justice being replaced was the swing vote on abortion, and all hell broke loose.<br> <br> The judicial confirmation process, on the point of breakdown for thirty years, now proved utterly dysfunctional. Unverified accusations of sexual assault became weapons in a ruthless campaign of personal destruction,&nbsp;culminating in the melodramatic hearings in which Kavanaugh&#x2019;s impassioned defense resuscitated a nomination that seemed beyond saving.<br> <br> The Supreme Court has become the arbiter of our nation&#x2019;s most vexing and divisive disputes. With the stakes of each vacancy incalculably high, the incentive to destroy a nominee is nearly irresistible. The next time a nomination promises to change the balance of the Court, Hemingway and&nbsp;Severino warn, the confirmation fight will be even uglier than Kavanaugh&#x2019;s.<br> <br> A good person might accept that nomination in the na�ve belief that what happened to Kavanaugh won&#x2019;t happen to him because he is a good person. But it can happen, it does happen, and it just happened. The question is whether America will let it happen again.</p><p><b>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY</b>, a senior editor at The Federalist and a contributor to Fox News, is one of the country&#x2019;s most thoughtful, prescient, and respected political commentators.<br> <br> <b>CARRIE SEVERINO</b> is chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network.

His legacy continues today and many teachers around the world regard this book as the most authoritative on the subject of piano playing.</p><p>Heinrich Neuhaus was born in 1888 in Elisavetgrad in central Ukraine (now Kirovograd) into a family of musicians. His mother, Olga Blumenfeld, was sister of Felix Blumenfeld, a distinguished pianist, conductor and teacher. Horovitz was one of his most famous pupils. Through his maternal grandmother he was related to Karol Szymanowski who became a lifelong friend. Heinrich Neuhaus was, strictly speaking, self-taught, and the main formative influence on his musical development came from Felix Blumenfeld. He made his first public appearance at the age of eleven, playing some Chopin Waltzes and an Impromptu. In 1902 he accompanied Misha Elman in a recital in Elisavetgrad. His first solo recitals took place in Germany and Italy while studying under Godowsky, in Berlin and Vienna. He returned to Russia at the outbreak of the First World War. In 1922 he began teaching at the Moscow Conservatoire and helped to create in 1932 the famous Moscow Central Music School for specially gifted children. From 1934 to 1937 he was Director of the Moscow Conservatoire, a post he relinquished so as to be able to devote himself entirely to teaching. Amongst his pupils were Radu Lupu, Emil Gilels and Sviatoslav Richter who called him and artist of unique genius, a great teacher and friend. Seldom have artistic gifts been so closely matched by the qualities of selfless devotion, deep humanity, true culture and a great capacity for bestowing and winning friendship. He died on 10th October 1964. This book bears witness to his achievements as a man, musician and teacher.I can unreservedly recommend this book. It contains not a single wrong or questionable remark, and is eminently practical. Three or four lines of print might suddenly open the eyes of this or that pupil, and change his whole career for the better ... in sum, a must. --Paul Hamburger</p><h2>Behemoth: The Structure and Practice of National Socialism, 1933-1944</h2><p>Franz Neumann's classic account of the governmental workings of Nazi Germany, first published in 1942, is reprinted in a new paperback edition with an introduction by the distinguished historian Peter Hayes. Neumann was one of the only early Frankfurt School thinkers to examine seriously the problem of political institutions. After the rise of the Nazis to power, his emphasis shifted to an analysis of economic power, and then after the war to political psychology. But his contributions in <i>Behemoth</i> were groundbreaking: that the Nazi organization of society involved the collapse of traditional ideas of the state, of ideology, of law, and even of any underlying rationality. The book must be "studied, not simply read," Raul Hilberg wrote.</p><p><b>Franz Neumann</b> was a political activist and labor lawyer in Germany who became a political scientist in exile.

Was it intended for him or the man who opened the drawer? They each had enemies enough to die a dozen times over. Was it the jealous wife or the ambitious partner? The secretary who got passed around like an inter-office memo? Or the man who couldn&#x2019;t wash the blood off his hands? Nero Wolfe didn&#x2019;t want any part of it&#x2014;but he was up to his neck in the toughest case of his career!<br><br> <b>&#x201c;It is always a treat to read a Nero Wolfe mystery. The man has entered our folklore.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The&nbsp;New York Times Book Review</i></b></p><p><b>Rex Stout</b> (1886&#x2013;1975) wrote dozens of short stories, novellas, and full-length mystery novels, most featuring his two indelible characters, the peerless detective Nero Wolfe and his handy sidekick, Archie Goodwin.1<br> &nbsp;<br> He grunted&#x2014;the low brief rumble that isn&#x2019;t meant to be heard&#x2014;turned his head to dart a glance at me, and turned back to Dr. Vollmer, who was in the red leather chair facing the end of Wolfe&#x2019;s desk.<br> &nbsp;<br> It wasn&#x2019;t just that he was being asked for a favor. If there was a man alive who could say no to a request for a favor easier than Nero Wolfe, I hadn&#x2019;t met him. The trouble was that it was Dr. Vollmer, whose house and office was only a few doors away, who had said he wanted one, and the favor score between him and us was close to a tie. So Wolfe was probably going to be stuck, and therefore the grunt.<br> &nbsp;<br> Vollmer crossed his long, lean legs and rubbed his narrow, lean jaw with a knuckle. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s really for a friend of mine,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;a man I would like to oblige. His name is Irwin Ostrow, a psychiatrist&#x2014;not a Freudian. He&#x2019;s interested in a new approach to psychiatric therapy, and he&#x2019;s working at it. Crisis intervention, they call it. I&#x2019;ll have to explain how it works. It&#x2019;s based on&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;First aid,&#x201d; Wolfe said. &#x201c;Emotional tourniquet.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How&#x2014;you know about it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I read. I read for various purposes, and one of them is to learn what my fellow beings are up to. There are several thousand emergency-treatment centers now operating in this country. The Detroit Psychiatric Institute has a Suicide Prevention Center. The crisis center at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta is staffed by psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, lay therapists, and clergymen. The director of clinical psychiatry at San Francisco General Hospital has written and spoken at length about it. His name is Decker.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s his first name?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Barry.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Vollmer shook his head. &#x201c;You know,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;you are the most improbable combination of ignorance and knowledge on earth. You don&#x2019;t know what a linebacker does. You don&#x2019;t know what a fugue is.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I try to know what I need to know. I make sure to know what I want to know.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What if it&#x2019;s unknowable?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Only philosophers and fools waste time on the unknowable. I am neither. What does Dr. Ostrow want to know?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Vollmer slid back in the red leather chair, which was deep. &#x201c;Well. I don&#x2019;t want to bore you with things you already know. If I do, stop me. The Washington Heights Crisis Clinic is on 178th Street, near Broadway. It&#x2019;s a storefront operation; people can just walk in, and they do. A woman who can&#x2019;t stop beating her two-year-old daughter. A man who keeps getting up in the middle of the night and going outdoors in his pajamas. Most of them are on the way to a mental hospital if they&#x2019;re not headed off quick, and the clinic&#x2014;but you know all that. Eight days ago, a week ago yesterday, a young man came and told a nurse he needed help and she sent him in to Irwin&#x2014;Dr. Ostrow. He gave the nurse his name, Ronald Seaver.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Vollmer looked at me with his brows up. &#x201c;I hope they don&#x2019;t have to go to a crisis clinic,&#x201d; I said, and turned to Wolfe. &#x201c;One of your ignorance areas, baseball. Ron Swoboda is an outfielder and Tom Seaver is a pitcher. &#x2018;Ron Seaver&#x2019; is obviously a phony, but it might help to know he&#x2019;s a Met fan, if a clue is needed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It is,&#x201d; Vollmer said. &#x201c;Of course Irwin knew it was an alias, but people often do that their first visit. But he came back five days later, Saturday morning, and again the next day, Sunday, and he not only hasn&#x2019;t told his real name, he won&#x2019;t give any facts at all except what his crisis is. It&#x2019;s blood on his hands. His hands get covered with blood, not visible to anybody else, and he goes and washes them. The first time, ten days ago&#x2014;no, twelve&#x2014;it was in the middle of the night and he had to go to the bathroom and wash his hands. It happens any time, no pattern, day or night, but usually when he&#x2019;s alone. A nurse there says it&#x2019;s the Lady Macbeth syndrome. He says he knows of no event or experience that could have caused it, but Irwin is sure he&#x2019;s lying.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He turned a palm up. &#x201c;So that&#x2019;s his crisis. Irwin says he really has one, a severe one; the possibility of a complete mental breakup is indicated. But they can&#x2019;t get through to him. One of Irwin&#x2019;s colleagues there is a woman, a lay therapist, who has had remarkable success with some tough ones, even catatonics, but after two hours with him&#x2014;that was Sunday, day before yesterday&#x2014;she told him he was wasting his time and theirs. Then she said she had alternative suggestions: either he could go to a surgeon and have his hands amputated, or he could go to a detective, perhaps Nero Wolfe, and try to dodge his questions. And do you know what he said? He said, &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll do that. I&#x2019;ll go to Nero Wolfe.&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My brows were up. &#x201c;He tried to,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;So that was Ron Seaver. He phoned yesterday around noon and said he wanted to come and pay Nero Wolfe a hundred dollars an hour to ask him questions. He wouldn&#x2019;t give his name and didn&#x2019;t mention bloody hands. Naturally I thought he was a nut and said no and hung up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Vollmer nodded. &#x201c;And he phoned Irwin and Irwin phoned me.&#x201d; To Wolfe: &#x201c;Of course the hundred dollars an hour wouldn&#x2019;t tempt you, but I didn&#x2019;t come to tempt you, I came to ask a favor for a friend. You said you make sure to know what you want to know. Well, Dr. Ostrow thinks it&#x2019;s possible that this man did have blood on his hands, and he wants to know if he can and should be helped. I admit I do too. I&#x2019;ve dealt with people in crises myself, any doctor has, but this is a new one to me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wolfe looked at the wall clock. Twenty minutes to seven. &#x201c;Will you dine with us? Shad roe Creole. Fritz uses shallots instead of onion and no cayenne. Chablis, not sherry.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Vollmer smiled, broad. &#x201c;Knowing how few people get invited to your table, I should beam. But I know it&#x2019;s only compassion for my&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I am not compassionate.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hah. You think my meals are like the one Johnson described to Boswell: &#x2018;ill-killed, ill-dressed, ill-cooked, and ill-served,&#x2019; and you feel sorry for me. Thank you, but I have things to do before I eat. If I could come tomorrow and bring that man&nbsp;...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wolfe made a face. &#x201c;Not for dinner. I suppose he&#x2019;ll see Dr. Ostrow tomorrow, or telephone. If he does, tell him to come tomorrow evening at nine o&#x2019;clock. There will be no fee. And no compassion.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Paths Beyond Ego: The Transpersonal Vision (New Consciousness Reader)</h2><p>This book is a clarion call for an expanded vision of human possibilities. In it, many of the best thinkers of our day ask us to renew the perennial search for self-knowledge and to discover the deeper meaning of our lives.<br><br> For this, they offer the transpersonal perspective -- which extends beyond consciousness in its myriad forms, including altered states, yoga, dreams, and contemplation. This marriage of psychology and science with the spiritual traditions has borne ripe fruit: the transpersonal vision, which offers a uniquely generous and encompassing view of human nature.<br><br> The fifty essays that make up <b>Paths Beyond Ego</b> apply transpersonal thinking to individual growth, psychotherapy, meditation, dreams, psychedelics, science, ethics, philosophy, ecology, and service. The result is an integrated and comprehensive overview of the many dimensions of human experience.<br><br> In clear, accessible writing, the contributors suggest that our potential for enhancing human abilities is much greater than previously suspected and that our tools for this grand undertaking are widely available today. The transpersonal vision offers great hope for the future -- and links us to the timeless wisdom of the ages.</p><p><b>Roger Walsh, M.D., Ph.D.</b>is professor of psychiatry, philosophy, and anthropology at the University of California at Irvine. He has published over a hundred articles and twelve books on science, philosophy, religion, and ecological issues, and his work has received over a dozen national and international awards.Foreword<br><br>John E. Mack, M.D.<br><br>We are witnessing a battle for the human soul between two opposing ontologies. In one view, the physical or material world is the ultimate, if not the only, reality, and the behaviors and experiences of living organisms, including ourselves, can be understood within the framework of potentially identifiable mechanisms. In this worldview consciousness is a function of the human brain, and its farthest reaches and greatest depths are, in theory, fathomable through the researches of neuroscience and psychodynamic formulations. In this view, life, in James Carse's words, is a finite game.<br><br>In the transpersonal view, the physical world and all its laws represent only one of an indeterminable number of possible realities whose qualities we can only begin to apprehend through the evolution of our consciousness. In this view, consciousness pervades all realities and is the primary source or creative principle of existence, including the energy-matter of the physical world. Until recently, Western philosophy and science, including psychology, have been dominated by the first view. The transpersonal vision is opening our minds, hearts, and spirits to the second. In this view, life is an infinite game.<br><br>Each worldview, the materialist and the transpersonal, has its accompanying epistemology (way of acquiring knowledge), and each has its consequences for human well-being and the fate of the earth. In the materialist universe we know the world at a distance, through our senses and the machines and instruments through which we can extend their reach, and by reasoned analysis of the observations that our empirical enterprises yield. We take pride in the objectivity that this way of knowing reflects, and we are suspicious of subjectivity and emotion, which are thought to distort the truth. In this framework, we rely on ordinary consciousness for information about ourselves and the surrounding environment and regard nonordinary states principally as exotic, pathological, or interesting for recreational purposes.<br><br>In the transpersonal universe or universes, we seek to know our worlds close up, relying on feeling and contemplation, as well as observation and reason, to gain information about a range of possible realities. In this universe we take subjectivity for granted and depend on direct experience, intuition, and imagination for discoveries about the inner and outer worlds. A transpersonal epistemology appreciates the necessity of ordinary states of consciousness for mapping the terrain of the physical universe, but nonordinary states are seen as powerful means of extending our knowledge beyond the four dimensions of the Newtonian/Einsteinian universe.<br><br>The consequences of the materialist worldview are all too familiar. By restricting the scope of reality and the domain of personal fulfillment to the physical world, while excluding from consciousness the power of spiritual realms, human beings are ravishing the earth and massacring one another with instruments of ever greater technological sophistication in the quest for power, dominance, and material satisfaction. The outcome of the continued enactment of this view will be the breakdown of the earth's living systems and the termination of human life as we know it. Psychology, in this paradigm, has limited its healing potential by following a therapeutic model in which one person treats the illness or problems of another, separate, individual, whose relevant world is confined to a few principle relationships.<br><br>The transpersonal vision offers the possibility of a different future for humankind and other living creatures. Through a deeper exploration of ourselves and the worlds in which we participate, transpersonal psychology enables human beings to discover their inseparability from all life and their appropriate place in the great chain of being. Central to this unfolding awareness is the rediscovery of the power of ancient methods of achieving altered states of consciousness, such as meditation, yoga, shamanic journeys, and the judicious use of psychedelic plants. New methods of self-exploration, such as the Grof holotropic breathwork method and modified forms of hypnosis, enable many people to experience realms of the unconscious and the mythic and spiritual universes from which we have cut ourselves off. Transpersonal psychology certainly has therapeutic applications. But its greater focus is upon healing, transformation, personal growth, and spiritual opening.<br><br>The poet Rilke once wrote that the senses by which we could grasp the spirit world have atrophied. The transpersonal vision, as set forth by its pioneers in this book, shows the way that these senses might be reawakened and opened to domains of being of which we have perhaps never before been conscious. If and when this occurs, we may again discover the sacred in ourselves and nature. It will then become unthinkable to foul the earth-nest of creation that has been mysteriously lent to each of us for such a brief time. For as we explore the multiple dimensions of universes of unlimited possibility, we may at the same time learn to participate in a harmonious relationship with our fellow human beings and other living species through a consciousness that is forever evolving.<br>Preface<br><br>When in the late 1970s we began preparing Beyond Ego: Transpersonal Dimensions in Psychology, our goal was to provide the first comprehensive overview of the exciting new field of transpersonal psychology. One of our challenges was to find enough review articles. Our challenge in editing a new overview for the nineties and the twenty-first century has been quite different: both easier and more difficult. It has been easier in the sense that the transpersonal field has expanded dramatically and good papers are abundant; it has been harder in that selecting among them is more challenging.<br><br>It rapidly became clear that transpersonal exploration has expanded far beyond its foundation discipline of psychology to encompass fields such as transpersonal psychiatry, anthropology, sociology, and ecology, thereby creating a multidisciplinary, transpersonal movement. It also became clear that in order to reflect this dramatic growth, more than a new edition of Beyond Ego was required; what was called for was a new book. The result is this book: Paths Beyond Ego: The Transpersonal Vision.<br><br>In preparing Paths Beyond Ego we had several aims. First, we wanted to provide an easily readable introduction. Transpersonal studies are of potential interest to an exceptionally wide range of people, from medical and mental health practitioners, researchers, and clinicians to social scientists, philosophers, theologians, and spiritual practitioners. We therefore wanted to provide a clear introduction to the field that required a minimum of specialized knowledge and would be accessible to readers from diverse backgrounds.<br><br>Within the available space we sought to provide as comprehensive an overview as possible. Therefore, we tried to include outstanding reviews of all the major transpersonal areas. In order to include as many areas and articles as possible, articles have been edited and condensed. Readers who want more detailed discussions of particular topics can consult the original articles as well as the recommended reading list.<br><br>We certainly hoped to convey a sense of the excitement of cutting-edge work in this field. We therefore sought articles that build on the foundation of earlier work and also point to fascinating emerging possibilities.<br><br>In addition to an introduction and overview, we also wanted to provide an integration of the field. We therefore chose articles of broad integrative scope and attempted to write introductions that point to connections and common themes wherever possible. Such an attempt seems particularly important for a field that stands at the crossroads of an extraordinarily wide range of disciplines and points to the interconnection and interdependence of all things.<br>Introduction<br><br>We are astoundingly ingenious creatures. We have gone to the moon, split the atom, unraveled the genetic code, and probed the birth of the universe. Indeed, modern civilization stands as a monument to the boundless creativity of the human intellect.<br><br>Yet, while evidence of our intellectual and technological genius is all around us, there is growing concern that in other ways we have seriously underestimated ourselves. In part because of the blinding brilliance of our technological triumphs, we have distracted and dissociated ourselves from our inner world, sought outside for answers that can only be found within, denied the subjective and the sacred, overlooked latent capacities of mind, imperiled our planet, and lived in a collective trance--a contracted, distorted state of mind that goes unrecognized because we share it and take it to be "normality."<br><br>There exist within us, however, latent but unexplored creative capacities, depths of psyche, states of consciousness, and stages of development undreamed of by most people. Transpersonal disciplines have emerged to explore these possibilities, and they emerged first in psychology.<br><br>The Evolution of Psychology<br>Western psychology was born from two distinct sources: the laboratory and experimental science on one hand, and hospitals and clinical concerns on the other. In its practitioners' efforts to establish it as a legitimate science, they modeled experimental psychology on physics, focused on observable, measurable behavior, and shied away from the unobservable world of inner experience. Experimental psychology became dominated by behaviorism.<br><br>Clinical psychology and psychiatry, on the other hand, were born of a concern for treating pathology. Since much suffering stems from unconscious forces, clinical work focused on the subjective and the unconscious. Clinical psychiatry and psychology became dominated by psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis and behaviorism thus laid the foundations of clinical and experimental psychology, which they dominated for most of the first half of the twentieth century, becoming known as the first and second forces of Western psychology.<br><br>But by the sixties there was growing concern that along with the many contributions made by these schools of thought, there were also significant restrictions and distortions. Increasingly it appeared that they could not do justice to the full range of human experience. They focused on psychopathology or generalized from simple laboratory-controlled conditions to the complexities of daily life, and they ignored crucial dimensions of human experience, such as consciousness and exceptional psychological well-being.<br><br>In addition, they sometimes pathologized vital transpersonal experiences. For example, Freud interpreted such experiences as reflections of infantile helplessness, while other psychoanalysts dismissed them as "regressions to union with the breast," or "narcissistic neuroses." As the philosopher Jacob Needleman put it, "Freudianism institutionalized the underestimation of human possibility."1<br><br>Humanistic psychology emerged in response to these concerns. In the words of Abraham Maslow, a founding father of both humanistic and transpersonal psychology, "This point of view in no way denies the usual Freudian picture, but it does add to it and supplement it. To oversimplify the matter somewhat, it is as if Freud supplied to us the sick half of psychology, and we must now fill it out with the healthy half. Perhaps this health psychology will give us more possibility of controlling and improving our lives and for making ourselves better people."2<br><br>Humanistic psychologists wanted to study human experience and what was most central to life and well-being, rather than what was easily measured in the laboratory. One discovery in particular was to have an enormous impact and eventually give birth to transpersonal psychology. Exceptionally psychologically healthy people tend to have "peak experiences": brief but extremely intense, blissful, meaningful, and beneficial experiences of expanded identity and union with the universe. Similar experiences have been recognized across history and have been called mystical, spiritual, and unitive experiences, or in the East, samadhi and satori.<br><br>Eventually researchers recognized that various Eastern traditions describe whole families of peak experiences, and claim to have methods for inducing them at will. It soon became apparent that peak experiences have been highly valued throughout history, are the focus of several Asian disciplines, and yet seem to have been significantly underestimated--even pathologized--in the modern Western world. Transpersonal psychology arose in part to explore these experiences.<br><br>Of course, humanistic and transpersonal studies did not arise in a cultural vacuum. Rather, they both reflected and fed the dramatic changes occurring during the sixties within the culture at large. These included the birth of the human potential movement and the questioning of the materialistic dream, both of which led some people to look within for the enduring satisfaction that external success and acquisitions had seductively promised, but failed to provide.<br><br>Psychedelics also had a powerful impact and unleashed an unprecedented range and intensity of experiences on a society ill equipped to assimilate them. For the first time in history, a significant proportion of the culture experienced alternate states of consciousness. Some of these were clearly painful and problematic. Yet others were transcendent states that demonstrated to an unsuspecting world the plasticity of consciousness, the broad range of its potential states, the limitations and distortions of our usual state, and the possibility of more desirable ones.<br><br>At the same time, the introduction of Asian meditative disciplines offered ways of reaching similar states and insights through non-drug means. Suddenly, experiences that for centuries had appeared to many Westerners as nonsensical or pathological became valid and valued in the lives of a sizable minority. Western culture has never been the same since.<br><br>The many social effects included interest in Asian cultures and traditions and in spiritual practices as diverse as yoga, shamanism, and Christian contemplation. Dissatisfaction with conventional values led to alternate life-styles such as voluntary simplicity and ecological sensitivity, which flourished to express and support the new perspectives. Within universities new research fields explored topics such as meditation, biofeedback, psychedelics, and states of consciousness. Yesterday's cultural curiosity had become today's mainstream research. Transpersonal psychologists sought to integrate these novel findings into a new discipline, and they were soon joined by researchers in psychiatry, anthropology, sociology, and ecology.<br><br>Definition and Description<br>What, then, is the transpersonal?<br><br>Transpersonal experiences may be defined as experiences in which the sense of identity or self extends beyond (trans) the individual or personal to encompass wider aspects of humankind, life, psyche, and cosmos.<br><br>Transpersonal disciplines study transpersonal experiences and related phenomena. Practitioners seek to expand the scope of their disciplines to include the study of transpersonal phenomena and to bring their particular disciplinary expertise to this study.3<br><br>Transpersonal psychology is the psychological study of transpersonal experiences and their correlates. These correlates include the nature, varieties, causes, and effects of transpersonal experiences and development, as well as the psychologies, philosophies, disciplines, arts, cultures, lifestyles, reactions, and religions that are ...</p><h2>IQ (An IQ Novel, 1)</h2><p><b>Winner of the Anthony, Macavity, and Shamus Awards</b><b>A resident of one of LA's toughest neighborhoods uses his blistering intellect to solve the crimes the LAPD ignores.</b> <b><br></b> East Long Beach.

First one, then another of the town firemen&#39;s wives has been murdered, a third has barely escaped an attempt on her life, and what at first seemed incredible appears to be only too true: A serial killer is stalking this sleepy little community near the Mississippi border. For fireman Mark Branning, the murders are a dash of icy water, waking him up to how much he really cares about his own wife, Allie. Their bad marriage had faded into an uneasy separation. Now, with a madman on the loose, Allie&#39;s life could be in danger--and marital problems or not, Mark is determined to protect her. The danger is much closer than either of them had realized. A terrifying encounter makes it clear that Allie is at the top of the killer&#39;s list.

Christmas trees and candles, angels and menorahs all come into play. Songs about dreidels and a silent night are sung. Ironically, it&#x2019;s Daddy Christmas who knows how to make the latkes and kugel dressing for the turkey. Then the relatives come and everyone tells stories of their own traditions. The wonderful artwork has a definite Maira Kalman look and feel. Using bits of collage for everything from the tree branches to the steam coming from the latkes, the inventive pictures not only help spring the story from the occasionally unremarkable text but they also perfectly capture the love that everyone in this mixed household shares. Religion often leads to arguments more than affection, so this is a book that could (and perhaps should) provoke discussion. It will certainly be a boon for families that need a road map to help them navigate the holidays.

These visually arresting narratives draw viewers into a dialogue about the dynamics of race, sexuality, and violence in both the antebellum South and contemporary culture. Walker&#x2019;s work has been featured in exhibits around the world and in American museums including the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim, and the Whitney. At the same time, her ideologically provocative images have drawn vociferous criticism from several senior African American artists, and a number of her pieces have been pulled from exhibits amid protests against their disturbing representations. <i>Seeing the Unspeakable </i>provides a sustained consideration of the controversial art of Kara Walker.<p></p><p>Examining Walker&#x2019;s striking silhouettes, evocative gouache drawings, and dynamic prints, Gwendolyn DuBois Shaw analyzes the inspiration for and reception of four of Walker&#x2019;s pieces: <i>The End of Uncle Tom and the Grand Allegorical Tableau of Eva in Heaven</i>, <i>John Brown</i>, <i>A Means to an End</i>, and <i>Cut</i>. She offers an overview of Walker&#x2019;s life and career, and contextualizes her art within the history of African American visual culture and in relation to the work of contemporary artists including Faith Ringgold, Carrie Mae Weems, and Michael Ray Charles. Shaw describes how Walker deliberately challenges viewers&#x2019; sensibilities with radically de-sentimentalized images of slavery and racial stereotypes. This book reveals a powerful artist who is questioning, rather than accepting, the ideas and strategies of social responsibility that her parents&#x2019; generation fought to establish during the civil rights era. By exploiting the racist icons of the past, Walker forces viewers to see the unspeakable aspects of America&#x2019;s racist past and conflicted present.</p></p><p>&#34;&#34;Seeing the Unspeakable &#34;is an extremely important work. Gwendolyn DuBois Shaw is the first writer to place this controversial young artist&#39;s work firmly in an art historical perspective. She combines careful scrutiny of the art&#39;s formal traits with wide-ranging iconographic analysis, canny theoretical interpretation, and a revelatory examination of the work&#39;s critical reception. The result is an extraordinary piece of scholarship.&#34;--Judith Wilson, University of California, Irvine<p>Gwendolyn DuBois Shaw is Assistant Professor of History of Art and Architecture and of African and African American Studies at Harvard University.

Kay lives in a vast old country house, and is looked after by an unpleasant duo: the oily and egregious Sir Theopompous and the petulant and punitive Sylvia Daisy Pouncer. In her zeal to educate Kay on the finer points of Latin grammar, Sylvia Daisy has even taken away all of Kay&#x2019;s toys. Life seems very dull, until out of an old family portrait steps Kay&#x2019;s great-grandfather, a sea captain, who, if legend is to be believed, made off with a fabulous treasure. <br><br>Soon Kay is engaged in a thrilling quest that begins each night as the clock strikes twelve, taking him into the enchanted and dangerous world of the Midnight Folk: pirates, highwaymen, talking animals, and a gang of witches led by none other than Sylvia Daisy (in cahoots, as in <i>The Box of Delights</i>, with the arch-villain Abner Brown). In the end, it is that ragtag team of old toys that rallies to support Kay and save the day.<br><br>A book to set beside C.S.

After being orphaned at an early age, he was sent to sea aboard the school-ship HMS <i>Conway</i> in preparation for a naval career. Masefield&#x2019;s apprenticeship was disastrous&#x2014;he was classified as a Distressed British Seaman after a voyage around Cape Horn&#x2014;and he soon left the ship. Arrangements were then made for him to join another ship in New York. But Masefield had other plans: he deserted ship vowing &#x201c;to be a writer, come what might.&#x201d;<br><br>At seventeen Masefield was living as a vagrant in America. He found work as a bar hand but eventually secured employment at a carpet factory. Thinking that journalism might allow him to write for a living, Masefield returned to England in 1897.<br><br>Masefield&#x2019;s first volume of oetry, <i>Salt-Water Ballads</i>, was published in 1902, however, it was not until the publication of <i>The Everlasting Mercy</i> in 1911 that he made his mark on the literary scene. The success of his second book was followed by the publication of several long narrative poems, including <i>Dauber</i> (1914) and <i>Reynard the Fox</i> (1919).<br><br>With the outbreak of the war, Masefield became an orderly at a hospital in France. He also took charge of a motorboat ambulance service at Gallipoli in 1915. After the Allied failure there, Masefield visited America and undertook a series of lectures in support of the war effort. IN 1930 he was appointed Poet Laureate, and five years later the much-loved Masefield was awarded the Order of Merit. He died on May 12, 1967, and his ashes were interred in Poets&#x2019; Corner, Westminster Abbey.<br><br>The two Kay Harker books, <i>The Midnight Folk</i> (1927) and <i>The Box of Delights </i>(1935), are Masefield&#x2019;s lasting contribution to children&#x2019;s fantasy literature. <i>The Box of Delights</i> is now an established Christmas favourite and as much a part of the season as Dickens&#x2019;s <i>A Christmas Carol</i>.<br><b>Madeleine L'Engle</b> (1918&#x2013;2007) was an American writer best known for her Young Adult fiction, particularly the Newbery Medal-winning <i>A Wrinkle in Time </i>and its sequels <i>A Wind in the Door, A Swiftly Tilting Planet, Many Waters, </i>and <i>An Acceptable Time</i>.In its playful inventiveness and eventfulness, this fantasy is the grandparent of <i>Mary Poppins</i>, of Joan Aiken's Dido Twite books, and even of Eleanor Farjeon's short story collections...Names such as Brassy Cop, Pimply Whatto and young Roper Bilges - or Sir Hassle Gassle - can still amuse, even after 80 years, and there are only a few moments when attitudes grate on modern sensibilities.

On board is Edward Morgan Forster, a reserved man taunted by writer's block, attempting to come to terms with his art and his repressed sexuality. Damon Galgut's brilliant fictional biography lures readers into E.M. Foster's heroic journey of self-discovery, as the novelist confronts his fraught childhood, falls in unrequited love with his closest friend, and finds himself surprisingly freed to explore his "minorite" desires as secretary to a most unusual Maharajah. Slowly, the strands of a story begin to gather in his mind: a sense of impending menace, lust in close confines, under a hot, empty sky. But it will be another twelve years and a second stay in India before the publication of his finest work, <i>A Passage to India</i>. <br><br>Shifting across the landscapes of India, Egypt, and England, Forster's life is informed by his relationships&#x2014;from Mohammed el Adl, an Egyptian tram conductor whose companionship becomes invaluable, to the Greek literary titan, poet C.P. Cavafy. This reimagining of Forster's life is at once enlightening, humorous and deeply convincing&#x2014;a clear ad sympathetic psychological probing of one of Britain's finest novelists. As <i>The Financial Times</i> notes: "The concern is Forster's inner life, and Galgut inhabits him with such sympathetic completeness, and in prose of such modest excellence that he starts to breathe on the page." Readers will share in his struggle with repression and self-acceptance, and witness the gradual unfolding of a literary masterpiece. <i>Arctic Summer</i> is a powerfully candid portait of an author, created by one of the finet writers of his generation.</p><p><b>Damon Galgut</b> is the author of <i>The Good Doctor</i>, a 2003 novel that won the Commonwealth Prize (Africa Region) and was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. <i>In a Strange Room</i> (Europa, 2010) was also shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize.

He lives in Cape Town, South Africa.Praise for <i><b>Arctic Summer</b></i><br><br>"Beautifully written and utterly compelling."<br><i>&#x2014;The Times</i><br><br>"The author has managed to craft a version of E.M. Forster that penetrates his inner life better than any conventional biography ever has."<br><i>&#x2014;The Economist</i><br><br>"The genius of this novel, which would well be one of the finest literary works published this year, lies in Galgut's exploration of the agony of unrequited love."<br><i>&#x2014;The Irish Times</i><br><br>"A remarkable, lyrical tribute."<br><i>&#x2014;The Guardian</i><br><br>"Galgut is extremely good on Forster's anxieties, his loneliness, his unworldliness, and his 'crumpled, second-hand appearance, which made him seem like a tradesman of some kind.' The portrait is beautifully nuanced, a mixture of bold, colorful strokes and delicat little flicks of the brush."<br><i>&#x2014;The Sunday Times</i><br><br>"The pain of unequal love and the desolating gulf between desire and fulfillment, so beautifully conveyed here by Glagut in the case of a long-dead writer, is as recognizable today as it was over a century ago."<br><i>&#x2014;The Telegraph</i></p><h2>Ida Elisabeth: A Novel</h2><p>In an effort to redeem her reputation, Ida Elisabeth imprudently marries her teenage sweetheart, Frithjof. Early in their marriage, she realizes that her charming husband is too irresponsible to support the family and sews dresses to make ends meet. When Frithjof becomes involved with another woman, Ida Elisabeth divorces him. The single mother moves with her children to a small town. Still young and good looking, the admirably hardworking Ida Elisabeth attracts the attention of a successful lawyer, who possesses the manly virtues that her husband lacked. As she contemplates marrying again, Frithjof, now gravely sick, reenters her life. Unlike Undset&#39;s famous historical novels, which are set in medieval Norway, the story of Ida Elisabeth unfolds in the 1920s. As in Undset&#39;s other fiction, however, Ida Elisabeth poignantly illustrates how poor choices affect the course of a person&#39;s life and how the suffering endured because of grievous mistakes can become the means by which a love is purified. Even in her historical novels, the Nobel Prize-winning Undset tackled contemporary themes. With its setting in modern times, Ida Elisabeth examines the difficulties inherent in male-female relationships as they are experienced in contemporary society. Undset&#39;s descriptions of the Norwegian people and countryside coupled with her profound understanding of the human heart won her worldwide literary acclaim. Both are powerfully displayed in this compelling drama about fidelity and forgiveness.</p><p>Undset is a realist in the truest sense of the word. She sees the real world in which people face the bitter consequences of selfish choices and in which suffering is unavoidable and yet potentially redemptive. In her acclaimed historical fiction, Undset shows us that the acceptance of suffering is the beginning of wisdom and also, paradoxically, the path to peace and lasting joy. --<b>-Joseph Pearce</b>, Author, <i>The Quest for Shakespeare</i><br><br>Undset's skillfully crafted novel explores with devastating simplicity and realism the quiet, hidden heartbreak experienced by a woman living with the consequences of a loveless marriage. The heroine's journey takes place within the evocative landscape of 1930s Norway but in many ways, it is a timeless portrait of the loneliness and guilt suffered by so many men and women when marriages break down. It will ring true with contemporary readers living at a time where marriage is so little appreciated and supported by society. --<b>-Fiorella de Maria</b>, Author, <i>Poor Banished Children</i></p><h2>Quarrels That Have Shaped the Constitution</h2><p><blockquote><p>Leading American historians describe landmark Supreme Court cases that have altered the U.S. Constitution</p></blockquote><p>Quarrels That Have Shaped the Constitution is a classic collection of essays on groundbreaking decisions passed down from the nation's highest court that have had profound and irrevocable impact on the ultimate laws of the land. From the <em>Dred Scott</em> case to <em>Roe v.

More than simply focusing on the significance of the decisions themselves, these essays introduce a remarkable cast of characters from every social strata&#x2014;smugglers and slaves, bankers and butchers, rebels, servants, laborers, and tycoons&#x2014;each of whom now has an indelible place in American history.</p></p><p><p>The Case of the Missing Commissions</p><p><b>BY JOHN A. GARRATY</b></p><p><i>(Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137)</i></p><p><i>Paradoxically, the first of our controversies and in some respects the most important rose from by far the least significant of causes and the meanest of motives. It is a tale of narrow partisanship, clashing ambitions, and a man seeking the humble office of justice of the peace for the District of Columbia.</i></p><p>It was the evening of March 3, 1801, his last day in office, and President John Adams was in a black and bitter mood. Assailed by his enemies, betrayed by some of his most trusted friends, he and his Federalist party had gone down to defeat the previous November before the forces of Thomas Jefferson. His world seemed to have crumbled about his doughty shoulders.</p><p>Conservatives of Adams's persuasion were convinced that Thomas Jefferson was a dangerous radical. He would, they thought, in the name of individual liberty and states' rights import the worst excesses of the French Revolution, undermine the very foundations of American society, and bring the proud edifice of the national government, so laboriously erected under Washington and Adams, tumbling to the ground. Jefferson was a "visionary," Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth had said. With him as President, "there would be no national energy." Secretary of State John Marshall, an ardent believer in a powerful central government, feared that Jefferson would "sap the fundamental principles of government." Others went so far as to call Jefferson a "howling atheist."</p><p>Adams himself was not quite so disturbed as some, but he was deeply troubled. "What course is it we steer?" he had written to an old friend after the election. "To what harbor are we bound?" Now on the morrow Jefferson was to be inaugurated, and Adams was so disgruntled that he was unwilling to remain for the ceremonies, the first to be held in the new capital on the Potomac. At the moment, however, John Adams was still President of the United States, and not about to abandon what he called "all virtuous exertion" in the pursuit of his duty. Sitting at his desk in the damp, drafty, still unfinished sandstone "palace" soon to be known as the White House, he was writing his name on official papers in his large, quavering hand.</p><p>The documents he was signing were mostly commissions appointing various staunch Federalists to positions in the national judiciary, but the President did not consider his actions routine. On the contrary: he believed he was saving the Republic itself. Jefferson was to be President and his Democratic Republicans would control Congress, but the courts, thank goodness, would be beyond his control. As soon as the extent of Jefferson's triumph was known, Adams had determined to make the judiciary a stronghold of Federalism. Responding enthusiastically to his request, the lame-duck Congress had established sixteen new circuit judgeships (and a host of marshals, attorneys, and clerks as well). It had also given the President authority to create as many justices of the peace for the new District of Columbia as he saw fit, and--to postpone the evil day when Jefferson would be able to put one of his sympathizers on the Supreme Court--it provided that when the next vacancy occurred it should not be filled, thus reducing the Court from six justices to five. </p><p>In this same period between the election and Jefferson's inauguration, Chief Justice Ellsworth, who was old and feeble, had resigned, and Adams had replaced him with Secretary of State Marshall. John Marshall was primarily a soldier and politician; he knew relatively little of the law. But he had a powerful mind, and, as Adams reflected, his "reading of the science" was "fresh in his head." He was also but forty-five years of age, and vigorous. A more forceful opponent of Jeffersonian principles would have been hard to find.</p><p>Marshall had been confirmed by the Senate on January 27, and without resigning as secretary of state he had begun at once to help Adams strengthen the judicial branch of the government. Perforce they had worked rapidly, for time was short. The new courts were authorized by Congress on February 13; within two weeks Adams had submitted a full slate of officials for confirmation by the Senate. The new justices of the peace for the District of Columbia were authorized on February 27; within three days Adams had submitted for confirmation the names of no less than forty-two justices for that sparsely populated region. The Federalist Senate had done its part nobly too, pushing through the necessary confirmations with dispatch. Now, in the lamplight of his last night in Washington, John Adams was affixing his signature to the commissions appointing these "midnight justices" to office.</p><p>Working with his customary diligence, Adams completed hiswork by nine o'clock, and went off to bed for the last time as Presi-dent of the United States, presumably with a clear conscience. Thepapers were carried to the State Department, where Secretary Mar-shall was to affix to each the Great Seal of the United States and seeto it that the documents were then dispatched to the new appoin-tees. But Marshall, a Virginian with something of the easygoingcarelessness about detail that is said to be characteristic of South-erners, failed to complete this routine task. All the important newcircuit judgeships were taken care of, and most of the other appoint-ments as well.

Publishing three books&#x2014;one book every other year while running a consulting company and doing a lot of coding, training, mentoring, speaking, and writing articles, columns, and blogs&#x2014;not to mention raising a family and enjoying a grandfamily can be quite a challenge. But I love it.</p> <p>Agile development is the ability to develop software quickly, in the face of rapidly changing requirements. In order to achieve this agility, we need to use practices that provide the necessary discipline and feedback. We need to employ design principles that keep our software flexible and maintainable, and we need to know the design patterns that have been shown to balance those principles for specific problems. This book is an attempt to knit all three of these concepts together into a functioning whole.</p> <p>This book describes those principles, patterns, and practices and then demonstrates how they are applied by walking through dozens of different case studies. More important, the case studies are not presented as complete works. Rather, they are designs <i>in progress.</i> You will see the designers make mistakes and observe how they identify them as mistakes and eventually correct them. You will see the designers puzzle over conundrums and worry over ambiguities and trade-offs. You will see the <i>act</i> of design.</p> <p><b>Micah&#x2019;s Introduction</b></p> <p>In early 2005, I was on a small development team that began work on a .NET application to be written in C#. Using agile development practices was mandatory, which is one of the reasons I was involved. Although I had used C# before, most of my programming experience was in Java and C++. I didn&#x2019;t think that working in .NET would make much difference; in the end it didn&#x2019;t.</p> <p>Two months into the project, we made our first release. It was a partial release containing only a fraction of all the intended features, but it was enough to be usable. And use it they did. After only two months, the organization was reaping the benefits of our development. Management was so thrilled that it asked to hire more people so we could start more projects.</p> <p>Having participated in the agile community for years, I knew a good many agile developers who could help us. I called them all and asked them to join us. Not one of my agile colleagues ended up joining our team. Why not? Perhaps the most overwhelming reason was the fact that we were developing in .NET.</p> <p>Almost all agile developers have a background in Java, C++, or Smalltalk. But agile .NET programmers are almost unheard of. Perhaps my friends didn&#x2019;t take me seriously when I said we were doing agile software development with .NET, or maybe they were avoiding association with .NET. This was a significant problem. It was not the first evidence I&#x2019;d seen of this problem, either.</p> <p>Teaching week-long courses on various software topics allows me to meet a wide cross-section of developers from around the world. Many of the students I&#x2019;ve instructed were .NET programmers, and many were Java or C++ programmers. There&#x2019;s no gentle way to put this: In my experience, .NET programmers are often weaker than Java and C++ programmers. Obviously, this is not always the case. However, after observing it over and over in my classes, I can come to no other conclusion: .NET programmers tend to be weaker in agile software practices, design patterns, design principles, and so on. Often in my classes, the .NET programmers had never heard of these fundamental concepts. <i>This has to change.</i> </p> <p>The first edition of this book, <i>Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices,</i> by Robert C. Martin, my father, was published in late 2002 and won the 2003 Jolt Award. It is a great book, celebrated by many developers. Unfortunately, it had little impact on the .NET community. Despite the fact that the content of the book is equally relevant to .NET, few .NET programmers have read it.</p> <p>It is my hope that this .NET edition acts as a bridge between .NET and the rest of the developer community. I hope that programmers will read it and see that there are better ways to build software. I hope that they will begin using better software practices, creating better designs, and raising the bar for quality in .NET applications. I hope that .NET programmers will not be weaker than other programmers. I hope that .NET programmers achieve a new status in the software community such that Java developers are proud to join a .NET team.</p> <p>Throughout the process of putting this book together, I struggled many times with the concept of my name being on the cover of a .NET book. I questioned whether I wanted my name associated with .NET and all the negative connotations that seemed to come with it. Yet I can no longer deny it. I am a .NET programmer. No! An agile .NET programmer. And I&#x2019;m proud of it.</p> <p><b>About This Book</b></p> <p><b>A Little History</b></p> <p>In the early 1990s I (Bob) wrote <i>Designing Object-Oriented C++ Applications Using the Booch Method.</i> That book was something of a magnum opus for me, and I was very pleased with the result and the sales.</p> <p>The book you are reading started out as a second edition to <i>Designing,</i> but that&#x2019;s not how it turned out. Very little remains of the original book in these pages. Little more than three chapters have been carried through, and those have been massively changed. The intent, spirit, and many of the lessons of the book are the same. In the decade since <i>Designing</i> came out, I&#x2019;ve learned a tremendous amount about software design and development. This book reflects that learning.</p> <p>What a decade! <i>Designing</i> came out just before the Internet collided with the planet. Since then, the number of acronyms we have to deal with has doubled. We have EJB, RMI, J2EE, XML, XSLT, HTML, ASP, JSP, ZOPE, SOAP, C#, and .NET, as well as Design Patterns, Java, Servelets, and Application Servers. Let me tell you, it&#x2019;s been difficult to keep the chapters of this book current.</p> <p> <b>The Booch connection</b> In 1997, I was approached by Grady Booch to help write the third edition of his amazingly successful <i>Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications.</i> I had worked with Grady before on some projects and had been an avid reader and contributor to his various works, including UML. So I accepted with glee and asked my good friend Jim Newkirk to help out with the project.</p> <p>Over the next two years, Jim and I wrote a number of chapters for the Booch book. Of course, that effort meant that I could not put as much effort into this book as I would have liked, but I felt that the Booch book was worth contributing to. Besides, at the time, this book was simply a second edition of <i>Designing,</i> and my heart wasn&#x2019;t in it. If I was going to say something, I wanted to say something new and different.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the Booch book was not to be. It is difficult to find the time to write a book during normal times. During the heady days of the dot-com bubble, it was nearly impossible. Grady got ever busier with Rational and with new ventures such as Catapulse. So the project stalled. Eventually, I asked Grady and Addison-Wesley whether I could have the chapters that Jim and I wrote to include in <i>this</i> book. They graciously agreed. So several of the case study and UML chapters came from that source.</p> <p> <b>The impact of Extreme Programming</b> In late 1998, XP reared its head and challenged our cherished beliefs about software development. Should we create lots of UML diagrams prior to writing any code? Or should we eschew any kind of diagrams and simply write lots of code? Should we write lots of narrative documents that describe our design? Or should we try to make the <i>code</i> narrative and expressive so that ancillary documents aren&#x2019;t necessary? Should we program in pairs? Should we write tests before we write production code? What should we do?</p> <p>This revolution came at an opportune time. During the middle to late 1990s, Object Mentor was helping quite a few companies with OO design and project management issues. We were helping companies get their projects <i>done.</i> As part of that help, we instilled into the teams our own attitudes and practices. Unfortunately, these attitudes and practices were not written down. Rather, they were an oral tradition that was passed from us to our customers.</p> <p>By 1998, I realized that we needed to write down our process and practices so that we could better articulate them to our customers. So I wrote many articles about process in the <i>C++ Report.</i> 1 These articles missed the mark. They were informative and in some cases entertaining, but instead of codifying the practices and attitudes that we used in our projects, they were an unwitting compromise to values that had been imposed on me for decades. It took Kent Beck to show me that.</p> <p> <b>The Beck connection</b> In late 1998, at the same time I was fretting over codifying the Object Mentor process, I ran into Kent&#x2019;s work on Extreme Programming (XP). The work was scattered through Ward Cunningham&#x2019;s <i>wiki</i> 2 and was mixed with the writings of many others. Still, with some work and diligence, I was able to get the gist of what Kent was talking about. I was intrigued but skeptical. Some of the things that XP talked about were exactly on target for my concept of a development process. Other things, however, such as the lack of an articulated design step, left me puzzled.</p> <p>Kent and I could not have come from more disparate software circumstances. He was a recognized Smalltalk consultant, and I was a recognized C++ consultant. Those two worlds found it difficult to communicate with each other. There was an almost Kuhnian3 paradigm gulf between them.</p> <p>Under other circumstances, I would never have asked Kent to write an article for the <i>C++ Report.</i> But the congruence of our thinking about process was able to breech the language gulf. In February 1999, I met Kent in Munich at the OOP conference. He was giving a talk on XP in the room across from where I was giving a talk on principles of OOD. Being unable to hear that talk, I sought Kent out at lunch. We talked about XP, and I asked him to write an article for the <i>C++ Report.</i> It was a great article about an incident in which Kent and a coworker had been able to make a sweeping design change in a live system in a matter of an hour or so.</p> <p>Over the next several months, I went through the slow process of sorting out my own fears about XP. My greatest fear was in adopting a process in which there is no explicit upfront design step. I found myself balking at that. Didn&#x2019;t I have an obligation to my clients, and to the industry as a whole, to teach them that design is important enough to spend time on?</p> <p>Eventually, I realized that I did not really practice such a step myself. Even in all the article and books I had written about design, Booch diagrams, and UML diagrams, I had always used code as a way to verify that the diagrams were meaningful. In all my customer consulting, I would spend an hour or two helping them to draw diagrams and then direct them to explore those diagrams with code. I came to understand that though XP&#x2019;s words about design were foreign, in a Kuhnian4 sense, the practices behind the words were familiar to me.</p> <p>My other fears about XP were easier to deal with. I had always been a closet pair programmer. XP gave me a way to come out of the closet and revel in my desire to program with a partner. Refactoring, continuous integration, customer onsite: All were very easy for me to accept. They were very close to the way I already advised my customers to work.</p> <p>One practice of XP was a revelation for me. Test-driven development (TDD5) sounds innocuous when you first hear it: Write test cases before you write production code. All production code is written to make failing test cases pass. I was not prepared for the profound ramifications that writing code this way would have. This practice has completely transformed the way I write software: transformed it for the better.</p> <p>So by fall of 1999, I was convinced that Object Mentor should adopt XP as its process of choice and that I should let go of my desire to write my own process. Kent had done an excellent job of articulating the practices and process of XP; my own feeble attempts paled in comparison.</p> <p> <b>.NET</b> A war is going on among major corporations. These corporations are fighting to gain <i>your</i> allegiance. These corporations believe that if they own the language, they&#x2019;ll own the programmers and the companies that employ those programmers.</p> <p>The first volley of this war was Java. Java was the first language created by a major corporpation for the purpose of gaining programmer mindshare. This turned out to be wildly successful. Java has indeed penetrated very deeply into the software community and is largely the de facto standard for modern multilayer IT applications.</p> <p>One responding volley comes from IBM, which via the Eclipse environment is capturing a large segment of the Java market. The other significant barrage comes from those consumate elaborators at Microsoft who have given us .NET in general and C# in particular.</p> <p>Amazingly, it is very difficult to differentiate between Java and C#. The languages are semantically equivalent and syntactically so similar that many code snippets are indistinguishable. What Microsoft lacks in technical innovation, it more than makes up for in its remarkable ability to play catch-up and win.</p> <p>The first edition of this book was written using Java and C++ as the coding language. This book is written using C# and the .NET platform. This should not be viewed as an endorsement. We are not taking sides in this war. Indeed, I think that the war itself will burn itself out when a better language surfaces in the next few years and captures the mindshare of the programmers that the warring corporations have spent so much to secure.</p> <p>The reason for a .NET version of this book is to reach the .NET audience. Although the principles, patterns, and practices in this book are language agnostic, the case studies are not. Just as .NET programmers are more comfortable reading .NET case studies, Java progarmmers are more comfortable reading Java examples.</p> <p><b>The Devil Is in the Details</b></p> <p>This book contains a <i>lot</i> of .NET code. We hope that you will carefully read that code, since to a large degree, the code is the <i>point</i> of the book. The code is the actualization of what this book has to say.</p> <p>This book has a repeating pattern: a series of case studies of varying sizes. Some are very small, and some require several chapters to describe. Each case study is preceded by material that is meant to prepare you for it by describing the object-oriented design principles and patterns used in that case study.</p> <p>The book begins with a discussion on development practices and processes. That discussion is punctuated by a number of small case studies and examples. From there, the book moves on to the topic of design and design principles and then to some design patterns, more design principles that govern packages, and more patterns. All these topics are attended by case studies.</p> <p>So prepare yourself to read some code and to pore over some UML diagrams. The book you are about to read is <i>very</i> technical, and its lessons, like the devil, are in the details.</p> <p><b>Organization</b></p> <p>This book is organized into ...</p></p><h2>Case Studies and Theory Development in the Social Sciences (Belfer Center Studies in International Security)</h2><p><p>The use of case studies to build and test theories in political science and the other social sciences has increased in recent years. Many scholars have argued that the social sciences rely too heavily on quantitative research and formal models and have attempted to develop and refine rigorous methods for using case studies.

It offers three major contributions to case study methodology: an emphasis on the importance of within-case analysis, a detailed discussion of process tracing, and development of the concept of typological theories. <i>Case Studies and Theory Development in the Social Sciences</i> will be particularly useful to graduate students and scholars in social science methodology and the philosophy of science, as well as to those designing new research projects, and will contribute greatly to the broader debate about scientific methods.</p></p><p>Alexander L.

They provide an invaluable research guide for any scholar interested in the case study approach. But the book is much more than an account of how to do case study research. The authors also offer a sophisticated discussion of the philosophy of science that will be useful to anyone interested in the place of case-study methods in broader debates about social science methodology, and they give a discerning analysis of policy-relevant theory that is sure to draw the attention of a research community increasingly concerned about the social and political relevance of modern social science.

Patricia Cline Cohen goes behind these first lurid accounts to reconstruct the story of the mysterious victim, Helen Jewett. <br><br>From her beginnings as a servant girl in Maine, Helen Jewett refashioned herself, using four successive aliases, into a highly paid courtesan. She invented life stories for herself that helped her build a sympathetic clientele among New York City's elite, and she further captivated her customers through her seductive letters, which mixed elements of traditional feminine demureness with sexual boldness.<br><br>But she was to meet her match--and her nemesis--in a youth called Richard Robinson. He was one of an unprecedented number of young men who flooded into America's burgeoning cities in the 1830s to satisfy the new business society's seemingly infinite need for clerks. The son of an established Connecticut family, he was intense, arrogant, and given to posturing. He became Helen Jewett's lover in a tempestuous affair and ten months later was arrested for her murder. He stood trial in a five-day courtroom drama that ended with his acquittal amid the cheers of hundreds of fellow clerks and other spectators.<br><br>With no conviction for murder, nor closure of any sort, the case continued to tantalize the public, even though Richard Robinson disappeared from view. Through the Erie Canal, down the Ohio and the Mississippi, and by way of New Orleans, he reached the wilds of Texas and a new life under a new name. Through her meticulous and ingenious research, Patricia Cline Cohen traces his life there and the many twists and turns of the lingering mystery of the murder. Her stunning portrayals of Helen Jewett, Robinson, and their raffish, colorful nineteenth-century world make vivid a frenetic city life and sexual morality whose complexities, contradictions, and concerns resonate with those of our own time.</p><p>In 1836, the murder of young New York City prostitute Helen Jewett and the ensuing trial of her lover captivated the nation. Jewett (her real name was Dorcas Doyen; Jewett used many pseudonyms during her short life) was an archetypal 1830s model of fallen virtue. A bright, literate girl who worked as a servant for a respected Maine family, Jewett became "disgraced," losing her virginity outside of wedlock, and eventually taking up work as a prostitute in bustling New York City. One of her clients, Richard Robinson, was a young clerk of uncommon literary talent. The two exchanged a long series of letters, often loving and careful, then as quickly as a summer storm, they turned violent and angry. Early on the morning of April 10, 1836, Robinson stabbed Jewett to death in her brothel room and set fire to her bed. Robinson was eventually acquitted of the crime despite an overwhelming amount of evidence that both placed him at the scene and his hand on the murder weapon. The decision was universally reviled, and Robinson became an outcast who eventually exiled himself to Texas.<p> Cohen ably places this rather ordinary crime within the context of 19th-century urban life and the development of a fledgling tabloid journalism, showing just how people throughout America came to be shocked by a crime that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. <i>The Murder of Helen Jewett</i> is as much about mores and customs as it is about a lost soul. <i>--Tjames Madison</i></p>"This is a wonderfully vivid work of detection and history. It unravels a murder mystery at the same time that it weaves a rich historical tapestry. It brings to life New York in the 1830s, and yet it bears an eerie similarity to one of the most infamous murder trials of our time. This is a book to savor."<br>Jonathan Harr, author of A Civil Action</p><h2>The Book of Camp-Lore &amp; Woodcraft</h2><p>This is our fourth &#34;handy book&#34; by Dan Beard, the founder of the American Scouting movement, who believed that having boys build things with their hands was not only a detriment to making mischief, but also the basis for building great lives. In this belief, Beard was indefatigable, and every Scout worth his merit badge was expected to read his classic tract on camp-lore and woodcraft, which included instructions on how to build a good fire, cook venison, prepare for a camping trip, and use an axe and a saw.</p><p>Daniel Beard was born in 1850 and lived most of his life in Kentucky. From an early age, Beard decided to devote his life to American boyhood. He was a prolific writer, illustrator, the founder of two different societies for boys and one of the original founding members of the Boy Scouts of America. Before his death in 1941, Beard received the only Golden Eagle badge ever awarded from the Boy Scouts of America, and had the mountain peak adjoining Mt. McKinley in Alaska named in his honor.</p><h2>Tattoo Sourcebook</h2><p>A lush sourcebook of nearly two thousand tattoo designs from artists around the world.

With her companion book <b>The Artist's Way Morning Pages Journal</b>, Cameron focused readers on one of two primary tools in her programs. Now <b>The Artist's Date Book</b> directs readers toward the second tool. Encompassing a year of creativity, with illustrations by <b>Elizabeth Cameron Evans</b>, 365 provocative tasks, and ample inventory space, it is whimsical, inspiring, entertaining, and wise. The book leads readers to involve themselves in daily meetings with their creative self, guiding them to authentic growth, renewal, and confidence.</p><p><b>Julia Cameron&nbsp;</b>has been an active artist for more than three decades. She is the author of more than thirty books, including such bestselling works on the creative process as&nbsp;<i>The Artist&#x2019;s Way</i>,&nbsp;<i>Walking in This World</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Finding Water</i>. Also a novelist, playwright, songwriter, and poet, she has multiple credits in theater, film, and television, including an episode of&nbsp;<i>Miami Vice</i>, which&nbsp;featured Miles Davis, and&nbsp;<i>Elvis and the Beauty Queen</i>, which starred Don Johnson. She was a writer on such movies as&nbsp;<i>Taxi Driver</i>,&nbsp;<i>New York, New York</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Last Waltz</i>. She wrote, produced, and directed the award-winning independent feature film&nbsp;<i>God's Will</i>, which premiered at the Chicago International Film Festival, and was selected by the London Film Festival, the Munich International Film Festival, and the Women in Film Festival, among others. In addition to making films, Cameron has taught film at such diverse places as Chicago Filmmakers, Northwestern University, and Columbia College. She is also an award-winning playwright, whose work has appeared on such well-known stages as the McCarter Theater at Princeton University and the Denver Center for the Performing Arts.<b>Praise for THE ARTIST'S WAY.</b>..<br><br>&#x201c;<b>THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY</b> by Julia Cameron is not exclusively about writing&#x2014;it is about discovering and developing the artist within whether a painter, poet, screenwriter or musician&#x2014;but it is a <i>lot</i> about writing. If you have always wanted to pursue a creative dream, have always wanted to play and create with words or paints, this book will gently get you started and help you learn all kinds of paying-attention techniques; and that, after all, is what being an artist is all about. It&#x2019;s about learning to pay attention.&#x201d;<br><b>--Anne Lamott, Mademoiselle</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The premise of the book is that creativity and spirituality are the same thing, they come from the same place. And we were created to use this life to express our individuality, and that over the course of a lifetime that gets beaten out of us. [<b>THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY</b>] helped me put aside my fear and not worry about whether the record would be commercial.&#x201d;<br><b>--Grammy award-winning singer Kathy Mattea</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Julia Cameron brings creativity and spirituality together with the same kind of step-by-step wisdom that Edgar Cayce encouraged. The result is spiritual creativity as a consistent and nourishing part of daily life.&#x201d;<br><b>--Venture Inward</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I never knew I was a visual artist until I read Julia Cameron&#x2019;s <b>THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY</b>.&#x201d;<br><b>--Jannene Behl in Artist&#x2019;s Magazine</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Julia Cameron&#x2019;s landmark book <b>THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY</b> helped me figure out who I really was as an adult, not so much as an artist but as a person. And award-winning journalist and poet, Cameron&#x2019;s genius is that she doesn&#x2019;t tell readers what they should do to achieve or who they should be&#x2014;instead she creates a map for readers to start exploring these questions themselves.&#x201d;<br><b>--Michael F. Melcher, Law Practice magazine</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;This is not a self-help book in the normative sense. It is simply a powerful book that can challenge one to move into an entirely different state of personal expression and growth.&#x201d;<br><b>--Nick Maddox, Deland Beacon</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;<b>THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY</b> (with its companion volume <b>THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY MORNING PAGES JOURNAL</b>) becomes a friend over time, not just a journal.

Crenshaw, M.D., San Diego Union-Tribune</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;If you really want to supercharge your writing, I recommend that you get a copy of Julia Cameron&#x2019;s book <b>THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY</b>. I&#x2019;m not a big fan of self-help books, but this book has changed my life for the better and restored my previously lagging creativity.&#x201d;<br><b>--Jeffrey Bairstow, Laser Focus World</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Working with the principle that creative expression is the natural direction of life, Cameron developed a three month program to recover creativity. <b>THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY</b> shows how to tap into the higher power that connects human creativity and the creative energies of the universe.&#x201d;<br><b>--Mike Gossie, Scottsdale Tribune</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;<b>THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY </b>is the seminal book on the subject of creativity and an invaluable guide to living the artistic life. Still as vital today&#x2014;or perhaps even more so&#x2014;than it was when it was first published in 1992, it is a provocative and inspiring work.

First published in 1992 and now in its seventh printing in English, with translations underway into Spanish, Korean, and Indonesian, Bevans&#39;s book is a judicious examination of what the terms &#34;contextual theology&#34; and &#34;to contextualize&#34; mean. In the revised and expanded edition, Bevans adds a &#34;counter-cultural&#34; model to the five presented in the first edition -- the translation, the anthropological, the praxis, the synthetic, and the transcendental model. This means that readers will be introduced to the way in which figures such as Stanley Hauerwas, John Milbank, Lesslie Newbigin, &#34;and (occasionally) Pope John Paul II&#34; need to be taken into account. The author&#39;s revisions also incorporate suggestions made by reviewers to enhance the clarity of the original three chapters on the nature of contextual theology and the five models.</p><p>Stephen B.

Julius Scott Jr., (Ph.D., University of Manchester) is emeritus professor of biblical and historical studies at Wheaton College Graduate School.</p><h2>Basic Freud</h2><p>In Basic Freud, noted psychologist Michael Kahn shows that even in the age of psychopharmaceuticals and cognitive therapy, Freud&#39;s major insights into the unconscious remain unsurpassed tools for understanding our behaviors, motivations, and emotions. Kahn presents key ideas such as the Oedipus complex, the repetition compulsion, guilt, anxiety, and defense mechanisms, along with recent research that has supported or expanded Freud&#39;s findings. Kahn also presents real case studies from his own work as a psychotherapist to show how Freudian thought has been instrumental in helping his clients discover who they are and escape from destructive patterns. Lay readers and professional psychotherapists alike will benefit from Kahn&#39;s fresh, informed, and unpretentious approach.</p><p><b>Michael Kahn, Ph.D.</b>, is Professor Emeritus at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a clinical psychologist in private practice. He is also director of a counseling center at the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco, where he trains psychotherapists. He is the author of The Tao of Conversation and Between Therapist and Client. He lives in Mill Valley, California.Clinical psychologist Kahn (emeritus, Univ. of California, Santa Cruz) believes that psychoanalytic theory is sound despite some flaws. Here he aims to introduce Freud to college-level students, therapists-to-be, and general readers, using a conversational style and brief case examples from his practice. Kahn covers all the usual suspects: the unconscious, psychosexual development, the Oedipus complex, the repetition compulsion, anxiety, defense mechanisms, guilt, dreams, grief, and transference. He also introduces the post-Freudian Heinz Kohut and, in doing so, shows himself to be an empathic, humane therapist. Some of the cases seem too pat, and Kahn's defense of the Oedipus complex includes the dubious Freudian claim that those who don't agree with it are too threatened to admit the truth. Still, this is a good book for academic and public libraries that complements Pamela Thurschwell's Sigmund Freud (LJ 11/15/00), which is for literary or general audiences, and Elio Frattaroli's trailblazing Healing the Soul in the Age of the Brain (LJ 8/01).

This riveting book is both an indictment of an agency that lost its way and an unprecedented look at the roots of modern terrorism, and includes a new afterword in which Baer speaks out about the American war on terrorism and its profound implications throughout the Middle East.<br><br>&#x201c;Robert Baer was considered perhaps the best on-the-ground field <br>officer in the Middle East.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Seymour M. Hersh, The New Yorker<br><br><b>From The Preface</b><br>This book is a memoir of one foot soldier&#x2019;s career in the other cold war, the one against terrorist networks. It&#x2019;s a story about places most Americans will never travel to, about people many Americans would prefer to think we don&#x2019;t need to do business with.<br><br>This memoir, I hope, will show the reader how spying is supposed to work, where the CIA lost its way, and how we can bring it back again. But I hope this book will accomplish one more purpose as well: I hope it will show why I am angry about what happened to the CIA. And I want to show why every American and everyone who cares about the preservation of this country should be angry and alarmed, too.<br><br>The CIA was systematically destroyed by political correctness, by petty Beltway wars, by careerism, and much more. At a time when terrorist threats were compounding globally, the agency that should have been monitoring them was being scrubbed clean instead. Americans were making too much money to bother. Life was good. The White House and the National Security Council became cathedrals of commerce where the interests of big business outweighed the interests of protecting American citizens at home and abroad. Defanged and dispirited, the CIA went along for the ride. And then on September 11, 2001, the reckoning for such vast carelessness was presented for all the world to see.<br></p><p>&#x201c;See No Evil is a compelling account of America&#x2019;s failed efforts to &#x2018;listen in&#x2019; on the rest of the world, especially the parts of it that intend to do us harm.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013;Wall Street Journal<br><br>&#x201c;Robert Baer was considered perhaps the best on-the-ground field <br>officer in the Middle East.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Seymour M.

Like much of what Congress has done about immigration since then, it was conceived in ignorance, was falsely presented to the public, and had consequences undreamt of by its creators. That May 1882 statute, which has long been treated as a minor if somewhat disreputable incident, can now be seen as a nodal point in the history of American immigration policy. It marked the moment when the golden doorway of admission to the United States began to narrow and initiated a thirty-nine-year period of successive exclusions of certain kinds of immigrants, 1882-1921, followed by twenty-two years, 1921-43, when statutes and administrative actions set narrowing numerical limits for those immigrants who had not otherwise been excluded. During those years a federal bureaucracy was created to control immigration and immigrants, a bureaucracy whose initial raison d'etre was to keep out first Chinese and then others who were deemed to be inferior.The most comprehensive historical work on American immigration policy posits a different periodization, distinguishing between "the development of a regulatory system" in 1883-1913 and a period that went "from regulation to restriction" in 1913-29.1 This seems to me to make a false distinction: in fact each narrowing of the grounds of admission to the United States made subsequent narrowings easier. The same would be true in reverse, when restrictions were progressively relaxed from 1943 on. In the decades following World War II, even as the immigration laws and regulationswere loosened and made less discriminatory, the second generation of immigration historians tended to assume that immigration would never again be a major factor in American life. From a vantage point at the beginning of the twenty-first century, however, it now appears that the period of intense restriction, which eventually resulted in very small numbers of immigrants, was a temporary rather than a permanent alteration in a general pattern.The clearest way to demonstrate the apparent continuity of immigration patterns in modern American history is to examine the percentage of foreign-born residents in the country, whom the census began to count only in 1850 vis-�-vis the gross number of immigrants admitted. The data show that between 1860 and 1920, a period when almost every aspect of American life was transformed, the incidence of immigrants in the American population was remarkably stable: in seven successive censuses, about one American in seven was foreign-born, the actual percentages varying only between 13.2 and 14.7 percent. The total number of resident immigrants grew steadily from 1850 to 1930, but their incidence in the population began to decline in 1910 and hit a low of 4.7 percent--less than one American in twenty--in 1970. This was well after immigration had begun to grow again, but the drop in incidence continued due to the high mortality among foreign-born because so many were old and so few immigrants had arrived in the previous four decades.a Because of depression, war, and immigration policy, fewer immigrants came to the United States between 1931 and 1971--7.3 million--than had arrived in the single decade 1901-10, even though the population in 1970 was more than twice as large as that in 1910. Since 1970 the number and incidence of immigrants have risen, but that incidence is still well below traditional levels. The commonly held perception that America is receiving an unprecedented proportion of immigrants is false.What has changed, however, have been American attitudes toward immigration and immigrants. One issue that this book explores is the dualistic attitude that most Americans have developed toward immigration and immigrants, on the one hand reveling in the nation's immigrant past and on the other rejecting much of its immigrant present.That the United States, along with a number of other "settler societies," is a nation of immigrants goes almost without saying.2 Despite this, most historians do not accord either immigration or immigration policy the attention these topics deserve, and the space allocated to them in most textbooks is both cursory and spasmodic. Most still maintain the old invidious distinction between the earlier "colonists" and the later "immigrants."The founding fathers knew that continued immigration was vital to help fill their largely empty new nation. Thomas Jefferson's list of complaints against King George III in the Declaration of Independence included the charge that the king had "endeavored to prevent the population of these States ... obstructing the laws for the naturalization of foreigners [and] refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither." Eleven years later the authors of the Constitution clearly had immigration in mind when they provided that Congress should "establish a uniform rule of naturalization" (Article I, Section 8) and made immigrants eligible for all federal offices save president and vice president. They also protected the foreign slave trade, a major source of immigration, by prohibiting interference with it for twenty years (Article 1, Section 9). When that period expired, Congress, at President Jefferson's invitation, promptly made that trade illegal, but did not interfere with either the domestic slave trade or slavery itself. The approximately 50,000 slaves smuggled into the United States after 1808 became the first illegal immigrants.President George Washington and all his successors through John Tyler took it as a given that continued immigration was vital for the health of the nation. While none made as blunt a declaration as the nineteenth-century Argentine statesman Juan Bautista Alberdi, who insisted that "to govern isto populate," their endorsements were unambiguous. Washington, addressing an association of Irish immigrants just after the battle of Yorktown, said:The bosom of America is open to receive not only the opulent and respectable stranger, but the oppressed and persecuted of all nations and religions, whom we shall welcome to participate in all of our rights and privileges, if by decency and propriety of conduct they appear to merit the enjoyment.3The anti-immigrant legislation of the John Adams administration in the late 1790s--the infamous Alien and Sedition Acts--was not so much an effort to restrict immigration as a desperate but vain attempt to keep Federalism in power and Jeffersonians out. Federalists generally opposed only those immigrants who they thought might vote for Jefferson. Apart from that episode, a pro-immigrant consensus long prevailed, a consensus well described in President John Tyler's 1841 message to Congress: "We hold out to the people of other countries an invitation to come and settle among us as members of our rapidly growing family."4Thus for the first sixty years, and beyond, immigration and naturalization laws were minimal. Congress quickly enacted a 1790 statute specifying that naturalization was restricted to "free white persons."5 The obvious intention was to bar the naturalization of blacks and indentured servants. (The French constitution of 1789 had similarly barred the suffrage of persons "in livery.") This naturalization act, as amended, was used later to bar the immigration of Asians, but there is no evidence that Congress had Asians in mind in 1790, and, in fact, a number of Asians were naturalized in the middle decades of the nineteenth century, at least one of them at the behest of the federal government.6 And the first statute dealing directly with free immigration was not enacted until 1819, when Congress ordered, as part of a statute dealing with import duties, that every vessel entering an American port deliver a manifest of passengers being landed to the collector of customs for that distriet.7 No other immigration statutes were enacted until after the Civil War.The political elites' positive consensus about immigration and absence of legislative regulation does not mean that immigration was universally popular. Many Americans had long held hostile feelings toward immigrants in general and certain types of immigrants in particular--a position that has come to be known as nativism. The historian John Higham, its premier explicator, has defined it as "intense opposition to an internal minority on thegrounds of its foreign (i.e., 'un-American') connections."8 I will use the word more broadly to describe persons, organizations, and movements that oppose immigration or the amount of immigration on whatever grounds, and I shall use it often in the plural.bAmerican nativisms are older than the United States. For example, early in the eighteenth century a Boston mob tried to prevent the landing of Protestant Irish and later in the century that transplanted Bostonian Benjamin Franklin published one of the first nativist tracts. His <i>Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind</i> (1751) had as its main target the burgeoning German immigration in Pennsylvania, but also demonstrated a broad, if to us curious, racism.Why should the Palatine boors be suffered to swarm into our Settlements, and by herding together establish their Language and Manners to the Exclusion of ours? Why should Pennsylvania, founded by the English, become a Colony of Aliens, who will shortly be so numerous as to Germanize us instead of us Anglifying them, and will never adopt our Language or Customs, any more than they can acquire our Complexion.Franklin's comments are typical of American complaints against immigrants irrespective of time and place: they have bad habits ("Palatine boors"); they are clannish ("herding together"); they don't speak English ("their Language"); and they are going to take over ("Germanize us instead of our Anglifying them"). These are the arguments used against Italians, Jews, and others a hundred years ago, and may be heard today against "Mexicans, Latinos, Hispanics, etc." The targets have changed, but the complaints remain largely the same. Their gravamen is simply this: they are not like us.Franklin went on to demonstrate the degree to which notions of race are relative rather than absolute. He noted that the number of "purely white People in the World is proportionately very small," but his notion of who was white was strangely narrow. Most Europeans were not white but, according to him, "swarthy": in this category he mentioned Spaniards, Ital-ians,French, Russians, Swedes, and Germans except for the Saxons, "who with the English, make the principal Body of White People on the Face of the Earth."Finally, Franklin proposed an explicitly racist immigration policy: "Why Increase the Sons of Africa, by Planting them in America, where we have so fair an Opportunity, by excluding all Blacks and Tawneys, of increasing the lovely White and Red?"9 Yet, although Franklin can justly be called a founding father of American nativism, he was a father with no intellectual children. And it should be noted that this theme does not recur in Franklin's writings and that the forty-five-year-old American had not yet been abroad when he wrote these sentences. In his old age he encouraged immigration from the European continent.cNo concerted anti-immigrant movement developed in America until almost a century later. But when many thousands of desperately poor Catholic Irish immigrants began arriving at East Coast ports in the mid-1840s, many of them fleeing the consequences of the terrible potato famine that killed more than a million Irish, the pro-immigration consensus was weakened. (Many of the immigrants had been subsidized to emigrate by Irish landlords and the British government.) In reaction, Massachusetts and New York passed laws taxing and otherwise impeding immigrants. These were appealed to the Supreme Court, which struck them down in the <i>Passenger Cases</i> of 1849, ruling that: 1) although the Constitution said nothing about immigration directly, it was clearly "foreign commerce," which the Constitution explicitly reserved to Congress; and 2) Congress's jurisdiction was preemptive so that even in the absence of any federal legislation, state governments could not regulate immigration.10Immigration had been growing very quickly in the antebellum decades. In the 1830s, 600,000 came, 1.7 million arrived in the 1840s, and 2.6 million in the 1850s, which amounted to a 433 percent increase over two decades. About a third of the immigrants were Irish, almost all of them Catholic, and another third were German, a large segment of whom were Catholics. Irish immigrants went largely to the northeastern United States, many entering through Boston and New York, with a substantial minority entering via Canada. Almost all Irish settled in cities as far south as Baltimore and as far west as Cincinnati: large numbers of them moved into newurban occupations such as policemen, firemen, and horse-car drivers, as well as unskilled labor. Unlike the Irish, almost no Germans settled in New England; most entered through New York, which supplanted Philadelphia as the chief immigrant port in the 1820s. German settlement in the East was concentrated between New York and Baltimore, but a growing minority settled within the area between St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Milwaukee, which scholars have called the "German Triangle." Many Germans came seeking farms and found them, while large numbers were skilled craftsmen.The frustration of Protestant nativist groups over the increasing immigration and the growing crisis over slavery were the preconditions for the first anti-immigrant mass movement in American history. In the 1830s and 1840s violent anti-Catholic riots occurred, primarily in New England and Philadelphia: in 1834, just outside Boston, a mob burned down an Ursuline convent; and in Philadelphia during the 1840s a number of mobs attacked Catholic churches. No organization accepted responsibility, as we say today, but by the early 1850s a new political movement had been born, directed largely against immigrants.The Know-Nothings, as contemporary opponents and later historians called them, were members of a secret Protestant fraternal organization, the Order of the Star-Spangled Banner, whose members had to be native-born white Protestants who took an oath to "[resist] the insidious policy of the Church of Rome, and all other foreign influences against the institutions of our country, by placing in all offices in the gift of the people, whether by election or by appointment, none but native-born Protestant citizens." Members of the Order were instructed to reply "I know nothing" to any questions about the organization.It had a meteoric rise, growing from just forty-three members to more than a million in a little over two years. A million white males represented almost one-eighth of the nation's potential electorate (in 1852 just some 6 million men voted for president). It is therefore no surprise that anti-immigrant candidates did well in the elections of 1854 and 1855, electing eight governors, more than a hundred congressmen, the mayors of Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago, and thousands of other local officials. Many states enacted anti-immigrant statutes in this period. In Massachusetts, for example, naturalized citizens were denied the vote until two years after they became citizens, an act that particularly outraged Abraham Lincoln. The movement's national agenda included lengthening the period required fornaturalization from five to fourteen ...</p><h2>The Secret Rooms: A True Story of a Haunted Castle, a Plotting Duchess, and a Family Secret</h2><p><b>For fans of <i>Downton Abbey</i><b>, t</b>his <i>New York Times</i> bestseller is the enthralling true story of family secrets and aristocratic intrigue in the days before WWI</b><br><br>After the Ninth Duke of Rutland, one of the wealthiest men in Britain, died alone in a cramped room in the servants&#x2019; quarters of Belvoir Castle on April 21, 1940, his son and heir ordered the room, which contained the Rutland family archives, sealed.

It was mid-morning on Thursday 18 April 1940 and they were gathered at the entrance to a suite of rooms. The door leading into them was made of polished steel; the colour of gunmetal, it was the type used to secure a walk-in safe.</p><p>The door was firmly closed.</p><p>The light from the dim bulbs along the windowless passage cast pools of inky shadows around the waiting figures. Piles of cardboard boxes were stacked against the bare stone walls. Marked &#x2018;Secret &#x2013; Property of His Majesty&#x2019;s Government&#x2019;, they were secured with steel binding.</p><p>The doctors &#x2013; Dr Jauch, a GP from Grantham, and Mr Macpherson, an eminent chest specialist &#x2013; had been in and out of the rooms since dawn.</p><p>Shortly before eleven o&#x2019;clock, the first footman, dressed in an azure tailcoat and navy-blue breeches, escorted Lord Dawson across the Guard Room. A coldly sumptuous hall, it was the first point of entry to the 356-room castle. Rows of muskets, taller than a man, and hundreds of swords, their blades sharp-edged and glinting, lined its walls. From the vaulted roof hung the tattered remnants of regimental colours, captured in battle. Directly in front of them, a magnificent staircase swept to the state rooms on the upper floors; and yet, as the footman led the King&#x2019;s doctor across the hall, he veered to the right, heading for its farthest corner. There, he ushered him through a discreet swing door. It marked the border between master and servant. They had stepped into the &#x2018;invisible world&#x2019;.</p><p>Behind the Guard Room, the entire ground floor was devoted to the smooth running of the Duke&#x2019;s household. A gloomy hinterland of fifty rooms, some cavernous, some no larger than a priest&#x2019;s hole, it was where the servants lived and worked. From here, a network of passages coursed through the castle: hidden routes, which spiralled up the narrow turrets and towers to the splendid rooms above, enabling the servants to carry out their duties unobserved.</p><p>It was through this labyrinth of passages, deep in the servants&#x2019; quarters, that the footman conducted Lord Dawson, arriving at the steel door where the other doctors stood waiting.</p><p>They were at Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire. Built in the Gothic style and situated on a ridge eight miles from Grantham, it belonged to John Henry Montagu Manners, the 9th Duke of Rutland. Aged fifty-three, he was one of the richest men in Britain. Three years earlier, he had carried the Sovereign&#x2019;s Sceptre at the coronation. His family had lived at Belvoir since the eleventh century. Looking south from the castle&#x2019;s Flag Tower, he owned the land as far as the eye could see.</p><p>Earlier that morning, the Duke&#x2019;s wife, Kakoo, had telephoned Lord Dawson. Her husband was desperately ill. He must come to the castle immediately.</p><p>Up in the Flag Tower, the clock struck eleven. Ten minutes had passed since Lord Dawson&#x2019;s arrival, but he had yet to be admitted to see the Duke. The sounds of distant industry drifted along the passageway: shouted orders; the banging of tools; the clatter of footsteps approaching on bare stone.</p><p>The sight of the King&#x2019;s doctor in the passage immediately caught the servants&#x2019; attention.</p><p>&#x2018;If there was something serious going on, the housekeeper and the butler would try and keep it quiet,&#x2019; George Waudby, the third footman, recalled. &#x2018;They might talk together, but they&#x2019;d be tight-lipped in front of us lower ranks. We were their inferiors. We were the lowest of the low. We were never told anything. Everything we knew depended on what we saw or overheard.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;We all talked. We weren&#x2019;t meant to, but we did,&#x2019; said Dorothy Plowright, the daughter of the boiler stoker. &#x2018;Every rank had its gossip: the upstairs maids, the kitchen staff, the footmen, they all had their grapevines.&#x2019;</p><p>Until that morning, the servants&#x2019; grapevine had had nothing to report. They had seen and heard very little. &#x2018;We knew the Duke was unwell. He had been ill for a week. But we didn&#x2019;t realize it was serious,&#x2019; said George Waudby. &#x2018;We rarely saw the Duke. He spent all his time in his rooms. Every day, all day, he was in there. That had been the case for months. We knew this because they were in our quarters. Of course we had no idea what went on in there. Those rooms were absolutely secret. But we were told it was where the Duke worked. Nothing struck us as unusual. His routine hadn&#x2019;t changed. He had carried on working as normal.&#x2019;</p><p>The servants had had no reason to believe the Duke&#x2019;s illness was life-threatening. Only two days previously, after spending the night at Belvoir, Lord Dawson had returned to London, satisfied that the</p><p>Duke was on the mend. Before leaving the castle, he had issued a short statement to the press:</p><p>The Duke of Rutland is suffering from pneumonia at his home, Belvoir Castle, and is now stated to be making satisfactory progress. The Duke, who is 53 and succeeded his father in 1925, was taken ill during last weekend.</p><p>That morning, however, the servants had reason to suspect that the Duke&#x2019;s condition had deteriorated. Shortly after breakfast, three mysterious-looking packages were delivered to the castle. From that moment, they were on tenterhooks.</p><p>The porter was on duty when the packages arrived at the lodge. Marked &#x2018;Urgent&#x2019;, they were addressed to Mr Speed, the Duke&#x2019;s valet. Two of the boxes were long and bulky; one was very heavy. The labels gave away their contents; they had come from Bartlett&#x2019;s of Jermyn Street, Suppliers of Oxygen Tents.</p><p>The castle&#x2019;s odd-job men were summoned to take the packages to the entrance of the Duke&#x2019;s room, where Mr Speed was in attendance. &#x2018;Besides the butler and the housekeeper, Mr Speed was the only ser- vant the Duke allowed in his rooms,&#x2019; George Waudby remembered. &#x2018;The rest of us were forbidden to go in there.&#x2019;</p></p><h2>The Perfect Horse: The Daring Rescue of Horses Kidnapped During World War II</h2><p><b>Handpicked by Amazon kids&#x2019; books editor, Seira Wilson, for Prime Book Box &#x2013; a children&#x2019;s subscription that inspires a love of reading.</b><br><br><b>In this inspiring young readers adaptation of Elizabeth Letts' <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, one American troop will save the world's most precious horses during the final stretch of World War II.</b><br><br>When a small troop of American soldiers capture a German spy, they uncover an unexpected secret: Hitler has kidnapped the world's finest purebred horses and hidden them in a secret Czechoslovakian breeding farm.

His gaze was like a poet&#x2019;s, directed inward. His oeuvre was the art of classical dressage. His verses danced on four legs. Pod�haj�sky looked as if he&#x2019;d been born to sit astride a horse. His long straight torso had no awkward angles, no rounded curves, nothing to detract from its elegant lines. But to look at the Austrian officer&#x2019;s forlorn expression was to understand that within, he carried a shadow. In 1918, after being severely wounded in the neck while serving in the trenches in Flanders, he had suffered from shell shock. His love for horses had brought him slowly back, but the deep stillness of a defeated warrior never left him.<br><br>On June 12, 1936, Alois Pod�haj�sky sat astride his mount, Nero, ready to enter the rectangular dressage arena that had been set out with meticulous precision on May Field, a twenty-�eight-�acre lawn just to the east of the Olympic stadium; it was the site of the Olympic competition in equestrian dressage. The fact that this pair was competing here, in the eleventh Olympic Games, against the top equestrian contenders from around the world, was unlikely indeed. Nero, a gangly brown Thoroughbred, had been bred to race, but having proven slow, he had been cast off for use as an army cavalry mount. The gelding had shown equally little talent as a soldier&#x2019;s charger, and the army had nearly sold him off before Pod�haj�sky decided that the horse showed potential and saved him from the auction block. Pod�haj�sky too was an almost-�reject, kicked out of Austria&#x2019;s prestigious cavalry officer training school after a back injury made him unable to bend at the waist, forcing him to abandon his first love&#x2014;�jumping. Unwilling to give up his passion, he kept riding even though he had to be lifted onto his horse. He would never forget the day in 1928, during a cavalry school lesson, when his riding instructor scrutinized Pod�haj�sky&#x2019;s stiff form in the saddle and said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re finished.&#x201d; But Pod�haj�sky had pressed on, working with his reject mount, dedicating his energy to the art of dressage. Just three years later, Pod�haj�sky had received the Austrian cavalry&#x2019;s highest honor: In 1931, he was sent to study for two years at the world&#x2019;s oldest academy of classical riding, the Spanish Riding School. The instruction he received in the classical art of horsemanship was as much a spiritual education as a physical one. Students neither entered their horses in competitions nor vied for any medals. They pursued perfection as an end unto itself. Pod�haj�sky&#x2019;s love for horses, for riding, for life, had been restored. Five years after being expelled from the cavalry school, Pod�haj�sky was representing his country at the Olympics. While Nero was neither flashy nor handsome, the gelding was willing and cooperative, and after several years of training, they had risen to the top of the sport: Today, they entered the arena as favorites.<br><br>Although Pod�haj�sky believed that the Austrian tradition of riding was without peer, he knew that many found his country&#x2019;s traditions backward-�looking. One of Pod�haj�sky&#x2019;s teammates was the oldest competitor at the entire Games, born way back in 1864. Pod�haj�sky&#x2019;s own love of Austria&#x2019;s equestrian traditions had started during his boyhood, and at eighteen, he&#x2019;d joined the cavalry. Posing for a portrait in 1916, wearing the uniform of his regiment, he looked younger than his eighteen years. His ornate uniform&#x2014;�fur-�muffed, spike-�helmeted, brass-�buttoned&#x2014;�could be mistaken for a costume. In his right hand, he held white gloves; at his left hip, a sword and scabbard. He resembled a boy playing dress-�up in his father&#x2019;s clothes. But Austria lost both the Great War and its empire, and the pomp and traditions to which he had sworn boyhood allegiance were mostly gone. What remained of the great Austrian empire was its tradition of horsemanship, which Pod�haj�sky still believed was the best in the world. Now was his chance to prove it with the eyes of the world upon him.<br><br>Nero&#x2019;s turnout was impeccable, each of his braids carefully wrapped in snow-�white adhesive tape, setting off the arched carriage of his neck. Pod�haj�sky looked resplendent in the olive uniform of the Austrian Republic. The failed racehorse and his reject rider were preparing to compete in one of the most complex and demanding sports. Of all equestrian sports, dressage requires the most discipline. Descended from intricate military maneuvers developed in ancient times, dressage asks horse and rider to execute a series of carefully prescribed movements. Just as ballroom dancing and pair skating command partners to work together seamlessly, in the sport of dressage, the rider performs an intricate pas de deux with his partner&#x2014;�a twelve-�hundred-�pound four-�footed beast. Great dressage demands more than skill; it engages a rider&#x2019;s inner wisdom and his ability to communicate with a mount in the silent language of horsemanship.<br><br>The arena was laid out with geometrical precision on the clipped lawn of May Field. Large pots of flowers were set up at intervals around the perimeter, adding vibrant splashes of color. In the distance, the impressive hulk of Olympia Stadium filled the horizon, festooned with the flags of many nations. Evenly spaced scarlet Nazi swastika banners stained its perimeter. Inside, a hundred thousand seats were filled to capacity for the track and field events. The crowd assembled to watch the dressage competition, though a quarter that size, was no less fervent. Men in white fedoras and women in colorful summer dresses speckled the field&#x2019;s stands like rainbow sprinkles on ice cream. Pod�haj�sky had committed to memory the complex series of movements that he would need to execute perfectly in the seventeen minutes allotted to him. If his horse stepped out of the low barriers that marked the boundaries of the twenty-�by-�sixty-�meter ring, he would be eliminated. Surrounding the arena were points marked by letters of the alphabet: If the program specified that a movement be completed as he passed that mark, the horse needed to begin or end the movement just as the rider&#x2019;s boot passed the marker.<br><br>In the sport of dressage, the rider spends years teaching a horse to perform movements on command that come naturally to horses in the wild. The horse has four ordinary paces: walk, trot, canter, and gallop, each with a different cadence. But in each of these paces, a wild horse will perform the gaits with a variety of nuances. For example, when a horse trots, it moves its legs in diagonal pairs with a two-�beat cadence. A wild stallion, showing off, sometimes elevates the simple trot to an art form&#x2014;�he coils his powerful haunches underneath him, slows down the tempo, and elevates each step, transforming the workaday gait into a balletic art. These exaggerated movements are innate in certain circumstances, but to coax a horse to perform them on command takes the utmost tact, sympathy, and meticulous training from a rider. In an advanced dressage test, a rider may ask a horse to perform a pirouette, whereby the horse&#x2019;s hindquarters remain almost in place while his forelegs canter a full circle around them, or a half-�pass, where a horse moves both forward and sideways, his body slightly bent around his rider&#x2019;s leg, his legs crossing each other. Each of these movements has been inculcated slowly, painstakingly, in a step-�by-�step process that takes years to complete.<br><br>As he awaited his turn, Pod�haj�sky hoped that his own long years of practice would pay off. His thoughts turned inward as he listened to the voice of his instructor at the Spanish Riding School, the man who had taught him to tap into riding&#x2019;s most ancient traditions. Every competitor on May Field had trained hard to be here. Everyone hoped to win an Olympic medal. But Pod�haj�sky had more at stake than the �desire to win a prize: He believed that the deep communion between rider and horse was something exalted. In an indifferent and sometimes cruel world, he wanted to embody what his years of patient training stood for&#x2014;�discipline, tradition, perfection for its own sake, passion given form. Winning a medal might be the final outcome of this endeavor, but for Pod�haj�sky, the endeavor itself mattered most.<br><br>Pod�haj�sky lifted his eyes to look over risers jammed with spectators. So strange that such a large crowd was gathered here to watch a spectacle that in some ways was so private. As Pod�haj�sky himself later commented, &#x201c;Excited applause does not help in the least; what is needed is perfect sympathy and harmony with one&#x2019;s partner.&#x201d; Practicing this most delicate art, Pod�haj�sky had learned to turn himself into an animal psychologist; he knew that success belonged to those riders who were able to ally themselves with their mounts. Today Pod�haj�sky would ride for Austria, but more than anything, he would seek to enter into an almost mystical state of union with his horse.<br><br>As Pod�haj�sky waited his turn to enter the arena, he watched the other competitors with a practiced eye. He knew that his stiffest competition came from the Germans, who had a home field advantage. He was certain that he and Nero could compete with the world&#x2019;s best, though as he looked across the field at the international panel of judges assembled there, he knew that this was not just a competition but also an elaborate game of political chess.<br><br>One hundred and thirty-�three riders from twenty-�one countries had gathered to compete in the equestrian events at the summer &#x2019;36 Games. Three years earlier, the National Socialist Party had catapulted Hitler into power. Designed to showcase the Nazi Party&#x2019;s Aryan ideals, the Berlin Olympics were a piece of nationalistic theater dressed up as a sporting event. The Nazis, in a clever propaganda move, had camouflaged many of the blatant anti-�Jewish policies that were already being enforced, removing anti-�Semitic street signs in Berlin and even toning down the rhetoric in the newspapers, but a latent menace and violence lurked just beneath the whitewashed surface.<br><br>On this very public stage, the equestrian events had a particular significance: The competitions were open only to members of the military. Uniformed officers rode their best horses in contests specifically designed to test the mettle of equestrian soldiers. The three different sports&#x2014;�dressage, Three-�Day Eventing (also called &#x201c;the Military&#x201d;), and Prix des Nations (stadium jumping)&#x2014;�could easily be viewed as a stage for international battle writ small. To mark this importance, the Prix des Nations, or Nations Cup, had been given the prime spot: just before the closing ceremonies, when the eyes of the world would be watching. For centuries, men had measured their military might by the worth of their horses. In 1936 Berlin, the equestrian competitions were psychological war games: a dress rehearsal for the much larger cataclysm that lay just over the horizon.<br><br>At one end of the judges&#x2019; dais, his face in a concentrated scowl, sat the most influential person at the equestrian site, Gustav Rau. Clad in a dark suit, his bald head covered by a felt fedora, Rau lacked the long limbs and regal bearing of a horseman, but what he lacked in panache, he more than made up for in acumen. This fifty-�six-�year-�old German was the mastermind behind every one of the equestrian competitions at the Olympics. Gustav Rau had overseen each detail of the equestrian events: from the selection of the judges to the layout of the courses, a preparation that had consumed the previous two years. In spite of being a civilian, he relied on the close cooperation of high-�ranking Nazi officials, in particular Hermann Fegelein, head of the SS Cavalry. Fegelein was the special prot�g� of Heinrich Himmler, Reich leader of the SS.<br><br>Gustav Rau watched from the dais as the next competitor prepared to enter the ring. He recognized Pod�haj�sky and Nero as the winners of several important competitions leading up to the Olympics, beating out top German entries. Today&#x2019;s test called for Pod�haj�sky and Nero to enter the ring at an extended canter and then stop on a dime precisely in the center of the arena.<br><br>Even though Pod�haj�sky wore white gloves, his movements were barely perceptible as he shortened his reins, a signal to Nero that they were soon to begin. The press had called the ex-�racehorse &#x201c;a long-�legged gelding without charm or personality,&#x201d; and indeed, Nero once was flighty and nervous, afraid of his own shadow. Just as they prepared to enter the arena, the words of the oldest groom from the Spanish Riding School came into Pod�haj�sky&#x2019;s head: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be nervous. The horse is all right.&#x201d; He relaxed his thighs and sank deeper into his saddle; he turned inward, listening to his mount. An old adage says that a good rider can hear his horse speak and a great rider can hear his horse whisper. As Pod�haj�sky listened to Nero&#x2019;s whisper, the whole world fell away, the flags, the crowds, even his own will to win. All that was left was himself, his horse, and the signal that passed between them, like a radio tuned to a frequency that only the two of them could hear. He was scarcely aware of the five judges lined up at the far end of the arena, one each from France, Germany, Sweden, Austria, and Great Britain. He took no notice of the German observer, Rau.<br><br>When the ringmaster gave the signal, Pod�haj�sky and Nero entered on a straight line at a controlled gallop, stopping smoothly so that �Pod�haj�sky&#x2019;s riding boot was centered at the exact midpoint of the arena, on the spot that, though unmarked, was known as X. Nero stood as still as a bronze statue while Pod�haj�sky swept off his visored military cap to salute the judges. Then the pair continued at a free walk, a deceptively simple movement that tested a horse&#x2019;s perfect obedience. Pod�haj�sky sensed Nero relaxing, elongating his neck as he felt the reins slacken just a bit. The horse seemed to take no notice of the fluttering flags, the crowds of people, or the roaring from the track-�and-�field events in the distance. With no obvious cue from his rider, Nero picked up a floating trot and proceeded to crisscross and zigzag through the arena, flawlessly executing each of the complicated prescribed movements as the twenty-�thousand-�plus members of the crowd leaned �forward in their seats in a collective spellbound hush. Nero, unprepossessing when standing still, now looked bright and lively, while his rider remained so motionless that he almost seemed to disappear.<br><br>For more than a year after Pod�haj�sky returned from the front in 1918, the injury to his neck prevented him from speaking above a whisper; he was mired in depression about the loss of the great empire that he had sworn his young life to serve. Only rekindling his love of horses had slowly pulled him out of his pit of despair. Now, as he neared the end of his ride, turning back down the centerline of the arena and halting once more at the X while doffing his hat in salute, the world seemed to glow in vivid hues. His ride had gone flawlessly, and as he dismounted, well-�wishers crowded around him, assuring him that he was certain to take home the gold medal. But Pod�haj�sky had no time to listen. He stripped off one white glove and reached into the hidden pocket sewn into the interior of his jacket. He extracted a sugar lump from his pocket, and the adoring crowd watched quietly while Nero daintily nuzzled up the treat from the palm of his master&#x2019;s outstretched hand. Pod�haj�sky laid his other hand on his horse&#x2019;s shoulder. The two had eyes only for each other.<br><br>Seated on the dais, the German judge was adding up his marks (each individual movement was scored separately, with some given more weight than others).

While there are many books on stars, there is only one <i>Celestial Handbook</i>. Now completely revised through 1977, this unique and necessary reference is available once again to guide amateur and advanced astronomers in their knowledge and enjoyment of the stars.<br>After an extensive introduction in Volume I, which gives the beginner enough information to follow about 80 percent of the body of the material, the author gives comprehensive coverage to the thousands of celestial objects outside our solar system that are within the range of telescopes in the two- to twelve-inch range.<br>The objects are grouped according to the constellations in which they appear. Each constellation is divided into four subject sections: list of double and multiple stars; list of variable stars; list of star clusters, nebulae and galaxies; and descriptive notes. For each object the author gives names, celestial coordinates, classification, and full physical description. These, together with a star atlas, will help you find and identify almost every object of interest.<br>But the joy of the book is the descriptive notes that follow. They cover history, unusual movements or appearance, and currently accepted explanations of such visible phenomena as white dwarfs, novae and super novae, cepheids, mira-type variables, dark nebulae, gaseous nebulae, eclipsing binary stars, the large Magellanic cloud, the evolution of a star cluster, and hundreds of other topics, many of which are difficult to find in one place. Hundreds of charts and other visual aids are included to help in identification. Over 300 photographs capture the objects and are works of beauty that reflect the enthusiasm that star gazers have for their subject.<br>Robert Burnham, Jr., who was on the staff of the Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, Arizona, conceived the idea of <i>The Celestial Handbook</i> decades ago, when he began assembling a notebook of all the major facts published about each celestial object.

These illustrations will attract young readers to the environmental science content. The books cleverly use fictional stories to impart non-fiction information regarding taking care of the Earth. Trina, the lead character in the series, shares facts about Earth's water, pollution, conserving energy, and taking care of the planet. The books even question misconceptions some children have, such as the amount of water 'floating' in the body (see page 7 in Watch Over our Water). The books also contain 'circles of facts' which are written in a nonfiction narrative to describe scientific information that is being shared by Trina in the stories. These facts are written in child-friendly language and the information should be attainable by young children. Though the books are picture books which will keep young children's attention, they are also written as simple chapter books, complete with a Table of Contents, Glossary, Index, and references for further study. There are also activities for children to do to reinforce concepts from the stories. <strong>The books lend themselves to helping young children conceptualize ideas about the environment, as well as learn about the structure of an informational text.

Henry Petroski, who combines a talent for fine writing with a deep knowledge of engineering and technological history, examines the story of the pencil, considering it not only as a thing in itself, but also as an exemplar of all things that are designed and manufactured.<p> Petroski ranges widely in time, discussing the writing technologies of antiquity. But his story really begins in the early modern period, when, in 1565, a Swiss naturalist first described the properties of the mineral that became known as graphite. Petroski traces the evolution of the pencil through the Industrial Revolution, when machine manufacture replaced earlier handwork. Along the way, he looks at some of pencil making's great innovators--including Henry David Thoreau, the famed writer, who worked in his father's pencil factory, inventing techniques for grinding graphite and experimenting with blends of lead, clay, and other ingredients to yield pencils of varying hardness and darkness. Petroski closes with a look at how pencils are made today--a still-imperfect technology that may yet evolve with new advances in materials and design. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>"Very engaging and wonderfully informative....

However, she is convinced that aspects of cognitive theory must continue to inform a broader and more inclusive paradigm in which western and nonwestern perspectives are considered. Although Dr. Richard-Amato believes that method as magical formula will not fit this paradigm, she thinks that method as a resource critically examined can serve as a useful component in the right environments. She suggests that the field move away from grammar/skill-based teaching and again toward interactive, content-based teaching (including relevant tasks and proficiencies. She argues that explicit grammar and skill instruction appropriately timed need to play an important role. In addition, dialogical language testing if properly developed could make testing processes much more like instructional processes. While emergent participatory language teaching has been an increasing presence in many classrooms, she thinks it would be a mistake to define it as a method or an approach. For it transcends both and gets to the very heart of the student-teacher relationship. It can now and in the future involve students more intimately in their own learning. Even more important to the postmodern world that could emerge will be teacher attributes such as openness, willingness to self-reflect, and ability to adapt to local situations/cultures.</p><h2>Exceptional Children: An Introduction to Special Education (10th Edition)</h2><p><p> <i>Exceptional Children: An Introduction to Special Education </i>has always been known for its innovation, strong research base and accessibility.&nbsp; The tenth edition has all of those strengths, but has a greater focus on highly effective, research-based practices that are described in a very step-by-step, applied manner.&nbsp; Heward presents an informative and responsible introduction to the professional practices, trends, and research that define contemporary special education while also conveying the diversity and excitement of this changing field.&nbsp; The book is for those teachers who will be professionals in the area of special education or those who are working with students that have exceptionalities.</p></p><p><p> <b>William Lee Heward</b> is Emeritus Professor of Education at The Ohio State University.

(how is it possible to put on 4 pounds overnight? Could flesh have somehow solidified becoming denser and heavier (repulsive, horrifying notion)); alcohol units 2 (excellent) cigarettes 21 (poor but will give up totally tomorrow); number of correct lottery numbers 2 (better, but nevertheless useless)?" </b><p> This laugh-out-loud chronicle charts a year in the life of Bridget Jones, a single girl on a permanent, doomed quest for self-improvement--in which she resolves to: visit the gym three times a week not merely to buy a sandwich, form a functional relationship with a responsible adult, and not fall for any of the following: misogynists, megalomaniacs, adulterers, workaholics, chauvinists or perverts. And learn to program the VCR. </p><p> Caught between her Singleton friends, who are all convinced they will end up dying alone and found three weeks later half-eaten by an Alsatian, and the Smug Marrieds, whose dinner parties offer ever-new opportunities for humiliation, Bridget struggles to keep her life on an even keel (or at least afloat). Through it all, she will have her readers helpless with laughter and shouting, "BRIDGET JONES IS ME!" </p><p></p></p><p>In the course of the year recorded in <i>Bridget Jones's Diary</i>, Bridget confides her hopes, her dreams, and her monstrously fluctuating poundage, not to mention her consumption of 5277 cigarettes and "Fat units 3457 (approx.) (hideous in every way)." In 365 days, she gains 74 pounds. On the other hand, she loses 72! There is also the unspoken New Year's resolution--the quest for the right man. Alas, here Bridget goes severely off course when she has an affair with her charming cad of a boss. But who would be without their e-mail flirtation focused on a short black skirt? The boss even contends that it is so short as to be nonexistent. <p> At the beginning of Helen Fielding's exceptionally funny second novel, the thirtyish publishing puffette is suffering from postholiday stress syndrome but determined to find Inner Peace and poise. Bridget <i>will</i>, for instance, "get up straight away when wake up in mornings." Now if only she can survive the party her mother has tricked her into--a suburban fest full of "Smug Marrieds" professing concern for her and her fellow "Singletons"--she'll have made a good start. As far as she's concerned, "We wouldn't rush up to <i>them</i> and roar, 'How's your marriage going? Still having sex?'" </p><p> This is only the first of many disgraces Bridget will suffer in her year of performance anxiety (at work and at play, though less often in bed) and living through other people's "emotional fuckwittage." Her twin-set-wearing suburban mother, for instance, suddenly becomes a chat-show hostess and unrepentant adulteress, while our heroine herself spends half the time overdosing on Chardonnay and feeling like "a tragic freak." <i>Bridget Jones's Diary</i> began as a column in the London <i>Independent</i> and struck a chord with readers of all sexes and sizes. In strokes simultaneously broad and subtle, Helen Fielding reveals the lighter side of despair, self-doubt, and obsession, and also satirizes everything from self-help books (they don't sound half as sensible to Bridget when she's sober) to feng shui, <i>Cosmopolitan</i>-style. She is the Nancy Mitford of the 1990s, and it's impossible not to root for her endearing heroine. On the other hand, one can only hope that Bridget will continue to screw up and tell us all about it for years and books to come. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>"Helen Fielding is one of the funniest writers alive and Bridget Jones is a creation of comic genius."<br>--Nick Hornby</p><h2>Saving Italy: The Race to Rescue a Nation&#39;s Treasures from the Nazis</h2><p><p><strong><strong><em>New York Times</em> Bestseller</strong><br><br> "A poignant, fascinating story, bringing to life the soldier-scholars who saved Italy's treasures."&#x2015;Evan Thomas, best-selling author of <em>Ike&#x2019;s Bluff</em> and <em>Sea of Thunder</em></strong></p> When Hitler&#x2019;s armies occupied Italy in 1943, they also seized control of mankind&#x2019;s greatest cultural treasures.

How can the salty taste and crunchy texture of potato chips, the unmistakable smell of dogs after they have been in the rain, or the exhilarating feeling of hanging on tiny fingerholds many feet above the last secure foothold on a cliff, emerge from networks of neurons and their associated synaptic and molecular processes? In The Quest for Consciousness, Caltech neuroscientist Christof Koch explores the biological basis of the subjective mind in animals and people. He outlines a framework that he and Francis Crick (of the "double helix") have constructed to come to grips with the ancient mind-body problem. At the heart of their framework is a sustained, empirical approach to discovering and characterizing the neuronal correlates of consciousness &#x2013; the NCC &#x2013; the subtle, flickering patterns of brain activity that underlie each and every conscious experience.</p><p>Born in 1956 in the American Midwest, Christof Koch grew up in Holland, Germany, Canada, and Morocco, where he graduated from the Lyc�e Descartes in 1974. He studied physics and philosophy at the University of T�bingen in Germany and was awarded his Ph.D. in biophysics in 1982. He is now the Lois and Victor Troendle Professor of Cognitive and Behavioral Biology at the California Institute of Technology. The author of several books, Dr. Koch studies the biophysics of computation, and the neuronal basis of visual perception, attention, and consciousness. Together with Francis Crick, his long-time collaborator, he has pioneered the scientific study of consciousness.When he was still a student, Richard Feynman hinted at a career to come as a scientific wonderer when he wrote: "I wonder why. I wonder why. / I wonder why I wonder / I wonder why I wonder why / I wonder why I wonder!" Such wondering, and meta-wondering, takes us to the heart of what geneticist-cum-neuroscientist Francis Crick (who would know) calls "the major unsolved problem in biology"--explaining how billions of neurons swapping chemicals give rise to such subjective experiences as consciousness, self-awareness, and awareness that others are conscious and self-aware. The body of literature attempting to solve this problem is extensive, and getting one's mind around the field is a herculean task successfully executed by psychologist Susan Blackmore in her delightful introduction, Consciousness. Presented as a textbook, it is so highly engaging that I recommend it for general readers, too. In many ways, the book is structured like a brain, with loads of independent modules (boxes and sidebars featuring profiles, concepts and activities) tied together by a flowing narrative and integrated into a conceptual whole. The easy problem, Blackmore says, is explaining each of the functional parts of the brain, such as "the discrimination of stimuli, focusing of attention, accessing and reporting mental states, deliberate control of behavior, or differences between waking and sleep." In contrast, the hard problem in consciousness studies "is experience: what it is like to be an organism, or to be in a given mental state." Adding up all of the solved easy problems does not equal a solution to the hard problem. Something else is going on in private subjective experiences--called qualia--and there is no consensus on what it is. Dualists hold that qualia are separate from physical objects in the world and that mind is more than brain. Materialists contend that qualia are ultimately explicable through the activities of neurons and that mind and brain are one. Blackmore, uniquely qualified to assess all comers (she sports multihued hair, is a devotee of meditation, and studies altered states of consciousness), allows the myriad theorists to make their case (including her own meme-centered theory) so that you can be the judge. Making a strong case for the materialist position is Gerald M. Edelman's latest contribution, Wider Than the Sky, offered as a "concise and understandable" explanation of consciousness "to the general reader." Concise it is, but as for understandable, Edelman understates: "It will certainly require a concentrated effort on the part of the reader." As director of the Neurosciences Institute in La Jolla, Calif., a Nobel laureate and author of several books on consciousness (Neural Darwinism, The Remembered Present and Bright Air, Brilliant Fire), Edelman has impeccable credentials. But science writing for a general audience involves more than expunging scholarly references and providing a glossary of technical terms as a substitute for clear exposition. To wit, on memory Edelman writes that "it is more fruitfully looked on as a property of degenerate nonlinear interactions in a multidimensional network of neuronal groups." Such prose is common throughout the book, which is a shame because Edelman is a luminously entertaining conversationalist, and his theory that the brain develops in a Darwinian fashion of neuronal variation and selection, and that consciousness is an emergent property of increasingly complex and integrated neuronal groups, has considerable support from neuroscience research. An ideal combination of exquisite prose and rigorous science can be found in California Institute of Technology neuroscientist Christof Koch's The Quest for Consciousness. A rock climber adorned with a tattoo of the Apple Computer logo on his arm, Koch takes an unabashed neurobiological approach, the natural extension of what his longtime collaborator Francis Crick started in 1994 when he wrote in The Astonishing Hypothesis "that 'you,' your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will, are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules." To me, the most astonishing aspect of this theory is that it is astonishing to anyone. Where else could the mind be but in the brain? Nevertheless, finding the neuronal correlates of consciousness (NCC) has proved elusive, so instead of concocting a grand unified theory, Koch and Crick undertook a very specific research program focusing on the visual system, to understand precisely how photons of light striking your retina become fully integrated visual experiences. Koch and his colleagues, for example, discovered a single neuron that fires only when the subject sees an image of President Bill Clinton. If this neuron died, would Clinton be impeached from the brain? No, because the visual representation of Clinton is distributed throughout several areas of the brain, in a hierarchical fashion, eventually branching down to this single neuron. The visual coding of any face involves several groups of neurons--one to identify the face, another to read its expression, a third to track its motion, and so on. This hierarchy of data processing allows the brain to economize neural activity through the use of combinatorics: "Assume that two face neurons responded either not at all or by firing vigorously. Between them, they could represent four faces (one face is encoded by both cells not firing, the second one by firing activity in one and silence in the other, and so on). Ten neurons could encode 210, or about a thousand faces.... It has been calculated that less than one hundred neurons are sufficient to distinguish one out of thousands of faces in a robust manner. Considering that there are around 100,000 cells below a square millimeter of cortex, the potential representational capacity of any one cortical region is enormous." Given that the brain has about 100 billion neurons, consciousness is most likely an emergent property of these hierarchical and combinatoric neuronal connections. How, precisely, the NCC produce qualia remains to be explained, but Koch's scientific approach, in my opinion, is the only one that will solve the hard problem. <p><i>Michael Shermer writes the Skeptic column for Scientific American and is publisher of Skeptic and author of The Science of Good and Evil (Henry Holt and Company, 2004).</i></p></p><h2>Chemical Process Safety: Fundamentals With Applications (Prentice Hall International Series in the Physical and Chemical Engineering Sciences)</h2><p><b>The Leading Guide To Process Safety Now Extensively Updated For Today&#x2019;s Processes And Systems <p> </p> </b> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As chemical processes have grown more complex, so have the safety systems required to prevent accidents. <i> <b>Chemical Process Safety, Third Edition, </b> </i>offers students and practitioners a more fundamental understanding of safety and the application required to safely design and manage today&#x2019;s sophisticated processes.</p> <p> <br> </p> <p>The third edition continues the definitive standard of the previous editions.

It pushes readers to uncomfortable&nbsp;places, where we aren&#x2019;t used to treading, and it forces us to confront&nbsp;what we naturally want to avoid.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And women are accused of being transgressive all the time&#x2014;or, at&nbsp;the very least, they are used to stepping outside of the carefully drawn&nbsp;boundaries that society has set for them. Women are told what to do&nbsp;and who to be. Women are taught to be sweet, to raise children, to stay&nbsp;in their place. Women are pushed to the edges of society, where they are&nbsp;expected to keep their mouths shut and their heads down. The marginalization&nbsp;of women may have been more overt in the past, at times when&nbsp;women couldn&#x2019;t vote or own property or work outside the home, but it&nbsp;still happens today. Women are still instructed to be good girls.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In any era, women become accustomed to entering unfamiliar spaces,&nbsp;including territory that they&#x2019;ve been told not to enter. When writing is&nbsp;an off-limits act, writing one&#x2019;s story becomes a form of rebellion and taking&nbsp;back power. Consider, for example, Margaret Cavendish, who in the&nbsp;1600s brazenly wrote about science and philosophy, two subjects then&nbsp;considered the purview of only male minds. More recently, Jewelle Gomez&nbsp;brought an African American and lesbian perspective to the vampire&nbsp;tale, which had long been the province of European male protagonists.&nbsp;Today, writers like Carmen Maria Machado and Helen Oyeyemi subvert&nbsp;the so-called safe storytelling formats of the fairy tale and the supernatural&nbsp;yarn, adding women&#x2019;s voices to these traditional narrative forms.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For women especially, writing is often a kind of noncompliance,&nbsp;which calls to mind the prisoners in the comic book series<i> Bitch Planet</i>&nbsp;by writer Kelly Sue DeConnick and artist Valentine De Landro (Image&nbsp;Comics, 2014&#x2013;17). The comic is brilliant&#x2014;it tells a female-driven dystopian&nbsp;story about women sent to a prison planet as punishment for being&nbsp;noncompliant. What a great word to describe the women in this book.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The writers you&#x2019;ll meet in <i>Monster, She Wrote</i> are all rule breakers.&nbsp;And here&#x2019;s the funny thing: society doesn&#x2019;t always pay attention to&nbsp;what&#x2019;s happening over there on the edges. So while society was ignoring&nbsp;them, they were taking up their pens. While everyone else has been doing&nbsp;their own thing, women have been doing theirs, crafting tales about&nbsp;scientifically reanimated corpses, ghosts of aborted children, postapocalyptic&nbsp;underground cities.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Horror has been penned by men and women alike, but it&#x2019;s important&nbsp;to acknowledge that women have been contributing to the genre&nbsp;since its inception. As you&#x2019;ll discover in the following pages, the horror&nbsp;genre that readers love today would likely be unrecognizable without the&nbsp;contributions of these women.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These misbehaving women who write horror in all its nasty forms.<br><br><b>The Queen of Horror</b><br><b>Shirley Jackson </b><br><b>1916-1965<br></b><br>In 1948, the <i>New Yorker</i> published a short story by a then-unknown&nbsp;writer. The tale, about an ordinary town with a sinister secret, so outraged&nbsp;readers that the magazine reported receiving more negative mail&nbsp;than ever before, including many subscription cancellations.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That story was &#x201c;The Lottery&#x201d; by Shirley Jackson, which went on&nbsp;to become one of the most famous short stories in American literature.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though Jackson had been an obsessive writer since her youth and&nbsp;began publishing her writing during college, &#x201c;The Lottery&#x201d; made her a&nbsp;household name. For decades she received letters about it, which typically&nbsp;fell into one of three categories: bewilderment, speculation, and&nbsp;&#x201c;plain old-fashioned&nbsp;abuse.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The New England setting of the story was an integral part of Jackson&#x2019;s&nbsp;writing, which often features main characters who are outsiders&nbsp;and find themselves persecuted in a hostile small-town&nbsp;environment.&nbsp;This was an experience familiar to Jackson.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Born in 1916, Jackson spent her childhood in California. She met&nbsp;her husband, the literary critic and professor Stanley Edgar Hyman, at&nbsp;Syracuse University, where they were students. The couple married in&nbsp;1940 and moved several times before settling in 1945 in North Bennington,&nbsp;Vermont, where Hyman took a faculty position at Bennington&nbsp;College. She wrote, in what has become a famous anecdote from&nbsp;her life, that when checking into a hospital for the birth of her third&nbsp;child, the nurse asked Jackson what her occupation was. Jackson replied&nbsp;that she was a writer, to which the nurse said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just put down&nbsp;housewife.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The truth was that Jackson always struggled against her roles as wife&nbsp;and mother&#x2014;or,&nbsp;to be more accurate, the roles that others cast her in.&nbsp;Professionally she was a successful author, but at home in North Bennington,&nbsp;she was Hyman&#x2019;s wife and the mother of four children. Her&nbsp;husband expected her to play the part of faculty wife: to maintain the&nbsp;household, to rear the children, to cook, to clean, and to entertain people&nbsp;he brought into their home. The residents of the college town never&nbsp;quite accepted her as one of their own, which likely informed how she&nbsp;wrote about various groups&#x2019; intolerance of outsiders (see: the stone-wielding&nbsp;townsfolk in &#x201c;The Lottery&#x201d;).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hyman controlled the family&#x2019;s finances, but often it was Jackson&#x2019;s income&nbsp;that kept them afloat. Jackson&#x2019;s posthumously published collection<i>&nbsp;Come Along with Me</i> (Viking, 1968; Penguin, 1995 reprint) contains&nbsp;an anecdote about a time the family needed a new refrigerator. So she&nbsp;wrote a story, was paid, and bought the fridge. In this way, writing was,&nbsp;for Jackson, a real kind of magic. Hyman encouraged his wife&#x2019;s work,&nbsp;especially because it supplemented his income. But when eventually her&nbsp;career eclipsed his, Hyman no longer tolerated her success and belittled&nbsp;her in front of his university colleagues. What&#x2019;s more, he was frequently&nbsp;unfaithful, being particularly fond of his former students.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&#x2019;s no wonder that Jackson wrote about women who were lonely&nbsp;and ostracized. Her characters are haunted, sometimes literally and&nbsp;sometimes figuratively, by pasts they can&#x2019;t escape. Jackson became a master&nbsp;of both types of hauntings, the supernatural and the psychological,&nbsp;the interior and the exterior.<br><br><b>Haunted Housekeeping</b><br> Haunted house stories are a staple in horror literature; nearly every writer&nbsp;of the genre has told one or two. None have come as close to perfection&nbsp;as Jackson in creating houses that loom larger than their actual size,&nbsp;describing a past that haunts the present. What also sets her domestic&nbsp;stories apart is how quickly and effectively the mundane scenarios she&nbsp;depicts turn violent. Even a setting as seemingly humdrum as a grocery&nbsp;store transforms into a downright bloodbath in <i>We Have Always Lived&nbsp;in the Castle</i>, her 1962 novel about two sisters living in a family home&nbsp;following an infamous multiple murder.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;The Lottery&#x201d; established Jackson as reigning queen of the horror&nbsp;genre, though she wrote everything from campus novels to darkly&nbsp;comic domestic sketches about family life. These sketches were first&nbsp;published in magazines like Good Housekeeping and Woman&#x2019;s Day and,&nbsp;later, in the books Raising Demons (Farrar, Straus &amp; Cudahy, 1957;&nbsp;Penguin Books, 2015) and Life among the Savages (Farrar, Straus &amp;&nbsp;Cudahy, 1953; Penguin Books, 2015). She cemented her status as a&nbsp;titan of terror with the 1959 publication of The Haunting of Hill House&nbsp;(Viking), which was adapted in 1963 into the film The Haunting,&nbsp;which then developed a cult following of its own. Director Jan de Bont&nbsp;brought a less popular adaptation to the screen in 1999. And in 2018,&nbsp;the Netflix series The Haunting of Hill House took the bare bones ofJackson&#x2019;s story into new territory.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hill House is a lovely work of&nbsp;ambiguity. Four characters from&nbsp;different walks of life converge on&nbsp;the titular property, which has a&nbsp;bad past and a bad reputation. Eleanor&nbsp;Vance, the protagonist, has&nbsp;answered an advertisement posted&nbsp;by Dr. Montague seeking assistants&nbsp;for a haunted house investigation.&nbsp;She sees it as the first adventure of&nbsp;her life, which until that point she&nbsp;has spent taking care of her invalid&nbsp;mother. Once the action begins, it&#x2019;s hard to tell if the four people are&nbsp;cracking under the strain of their isolation in the bizarre mansion, or if&nbsp;the house truly is haunted. It doesn&#x2019;t help that every angle in the building&nbsp;is off by a few degrees, and the decorations are . . . well, let&#x2019;s just say,&nbsp;strange. In addition to the usual cold spots, bangs and knocks, and even a&nbsp;s�ance of sorts, Jackson adds Eleanor&#x2019;s internal monologues in which she&nbsp;struggles to understand her morbid attraction to Hill House.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; With this book and others, Jackson drafted a blueprint for the modern&nbsp;haunted house in both literature and film. Stephen King modeled&nbsp;his Overlook Hotel in <i>The Shining</i> after another of Jackson&#x2019;s creepy&nbsp;settings, the Halloran house in <i>The Sundial </i>(Farrar, Straus &amp; Cuddahy,&nbsp;1958). Moreover, King wrote at length about his debt to Jackson in his&nbsp;nonfiction ode to the horror genre, <i>Danse Macabre </i>(Gallery Books reprint,&nbsp;2010), and in <i>On Writing</i> (Scribner reprint, 2010), his memoir on&nbsp;his chosen craft. Other authors who have cited Jackson as an influence&nbsp;include Neil Gaiman, Richard Matheson, and Sarah Waters.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If <i>The Haunting of Hill House</i> was the definitive haunted house&nbsp;novel, then Jackson&#x2019;s final completed novel, <i>We Have Always Lived in&nbsp;the Castle</i> (Viking, 1962), cemented her in the Gothic and horror traditions.&nbsp;Time magazine named it one of the ten best novels of 1962. The&nbsp;story focuses on the Blackwood sisters, Constance and Mary Katherine&nbsp;(nicknamed Merricat), who live with their infirm Uncle Julian in&nbsp;their fenced-in&nbsp;family estate outside of a New England town. Uncle Julian&#x2019;s&nbsp;poor health and the scorn the townspeople feel for the surviving&nbsp;Blackwoods are the result of a tragedy that occurred six years earlier.&nbsp;One night at supper, four members of the Blackwood family&#x2014;the&nbsp;girls&#x2019;&nbsp;parents, brother, and aunt&#x2014;were&nbsp;poisoned and died. Constance, who&nbsp;hadn&#x2019;t used the arsenic-laced&nbsp;sugar on the dinner table, was arrested for&nbsp;the crime but not indicted. The townspeople believe she got away with&nbsp;murder. Her younger sister Merricat had been sent to her room without&nbsp;dinner on that fateful night and now is the only member of the household who ventures outside; she also practices magic rituals in order to&nbsp;keep Constance safe. Out of the blue, their cousin Charles swoops in,&nbsp;believing he is the rightful inheritor of the estate, and establishes himself&nbsp;as patriarch.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Castle</i> is often praised, especially for its protagonist. Merricat Blackwood&nbsp;is an outsider, like many of Jackson&#x2019;s women, but she maintains an&nbsp;imaginative spirit and a fierce devotion to defending her sister and her&nbsp;home. Fans of the horror writer Paul Tremblay will recognize similarities in&nbsp;his protagonist Merry in <i>A Head Full of Ghosts</i> (William Morrow, 2015).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Blackwood sisters&#x2019; existence at the margins of their community&nbsp;reflects Jackson&#x2019;s own experience. She didn&#x2019;t quite fit in with the other&nbsp;wives of her small university town; she spent her days writing and tending&nbsp;children, but her nights were filled with more exotic fare. A lover of&nbsp;the occult, Jackson gave tarot readings to friends and family. She claimed&nbsp;not to believe in ghosts but she owned a crystal ball and a Ouija board&nbsp;and seemed to relish her reputation as a &#x201c;witch.&#x201d; Whether or not she&nbsp;practiced witchcraft is debatable.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shirley Jackson may not have been understood by the people who&nbsp;knew her, but her literary legacy is indisputable. As an example, consider&nbsp;the Shirley Jackson Awards, a juried accolade that has been given annually&nbsp;since 2007 for excellence in horror, thriller, and dark fantasy fiction.<br><br><b>Reading List</b><br><b>Not to be missed</b>: Need some Shirley Jackson in your life? Honestly,&nbsp;who doesn&#x2019;t? Jackson is best known for her novels<i> The Haunting of Hill&nbsp;House</i> and <i>We Have Always Lived in the Castle</i>, both available from Penguin&nbsp;Classics. &#x201c;The Lottery&#x201d; can be found in <i>The Lottery and Other Stories</i>,&nbsp;a 2009 Penguin reprint, among other editions. But Jackson&#x2019;s other&nbsp;novels are criminally underread. <i>The Sundial </i>is an apocalyptic tale with&nbsp;all the Gothic trappings: a family with a sordid past, a manor house with&nbsp;secrets, and a storm blowing in. Yet it avoids clich� thanks to a unique&nbsp;exploration of family relationships. The narrative quickly turns into psychological&nbsp;suspense, and readers must question whether the end of the&nbsp;world is, in fact, near. It is available in a 2014 Penguin edition, with a&nbsp;foreword by Victor LaValle.<br><br> <b>Also try:</b> As mentioned, the 1963 film adaptation of<i> Hill House</i> has&nbsp;gained a fandom of its own. The ten-part&nbsp;2018 Netflix series provides a&nbsp;fantastic reimagining (not a straight adaptation) of the novel that is well&nbsp;done and worth viewing.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Judy Oppenheimer&#x2019;s <i>Private Demons</i> (Ballantine Books, 1989) was&nbsp;the first full-length&nbsp;biography of Shirley Jackson. Oppenheimer interviewed&nbsp;Jackson&#x2019;s family and friends for a more complete portrait than&nbsp;a mere blurb on a book jacket could offer. In it she focuses on Jackson&#x2019;s&nbsp;supposed witchcraft and occult leanings...maybe a little too much.&nbsp;Ruth Franklin&#x2019;s more recent and thoroughly engaging <i>Shirley Jackson:&nbsp;A Rather Haunted Life</i> (Liveright, 2016) dives deep into Jackson&#x2019;s personal&nbsp;papers and notes from the Library of Congress archive and interweaves&nbsp;insightful readings of her works into a sharp yet sympathetic&nbsp;biographical portrait. If you read only one biography of Jackson, make&nbsp;it Franklin&#x2019;s.<br><br><b>Related work:</b> In a testament to Jackson&#x2019;s enduring allure, Susan Scarf&nbsp;Merrell&#x2019;s murder mystery <i>Shirley</i> (Blue Rider Press, 2014) features Jackson&nbsp;as a character. Like so many of Jackson&#x2019;s novels, this is a psychological&nbsp;thriller, with a young girl at the center. When the girl disappears, Jackson&nbsp;is a suspect. The director Josephine Decker began adapting the novel to&nbsp;film in 2018, with actress Elisabeth Moss playing Shirley Jackson.</p><h2>Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition (International Edition)</h2><p><p><b>A new edition of the essential text and professional reference, with substantial new material on such topics as vEB trees, multithreaded algorithms, dynamic programming, and edge-based flow.</b></p><p>Some books on algorithms are rigorous but incomplete; others cover masses of material but lack rigor. <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i> uniquely combines rigor and comprehensiveness. The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers.

Word columns in daily newspapers and numerous books attempt to satisfy their curiosity. Word histories are usually digested like pills: the user is interested in getting well, not in the chemistry of the prescribed medication. Those who send letters to the Editor also want a straight answer without bothering about how "editors" come by their knowledge. Therefore, they fail to realize that etymologies are seldom definitive and that the science of etymology is intensely interesting. Perhaps if someone explained to them that, compared to the drama of words, <em>Hamlet</em> is a light farce, they might develop a more informed attitude toward philological research and become students of historical linguistics rather than gullible consumers of journalists' pap."--Anatoly Liberman<br><br><em>Word Origins </em> is the only guide to the science and process of etymology for the layperson. This funny, charming, and conversational book not only tells the known origins of hundreds of words, but also shows how their origins were determined. Liberman, an internationally acclaimed etymologist, takes the reader by the hand and explains the many ways that English words can be made, and the many ways in which etymologists try to unearth the origins of words.<br><br>Part history, part how-to, and completely entertaining, <em>Word Origins</em> invites readers behind the scenes to watch an etymologist at work.<br></p><p><br><strong>Anatoly Liberman</strong> is Professor of the Humanities at the University of Minnesota.

He lives in Minneapolis.<br>"Word Origins is chock full of intriguing, accessible insights into how our language has evolved, mutated and otherwise morphed over thousands of years."--Pulse<br><br>"The erudite and winsome Liberman explains his work as an etymologist, which includes historical cases to crack and tall tales to debunk."--Chicago Tribune<br><br>"While Anatoly Liberman's study of the English language covers such interesting topics as sound-imitative words, compounds, coinages, and borrowings, it does so in a way that actually manages to be dense and scholarly and tongue-in-cheek and amusing, all at the same time."--Library Media<br>Connection<br><br>"Those seriously interested in the origins of our language, who actively want to find out more about the way etymologists work, and who along the way don't mind taking in some sobering guidance on the pitfalls of ferreting out word histories."--World Wide Words<br><br>"As a sideline to his long ongoing work on a new etymological dictionary of English, Liberman enlightens general readers...about the challenges faced by etymologists in tracing word origins and evolved meanins. His explanations cover philosophical musings, historical debates in the field, and<br>words imitating sounds."--Reference and Research Book News<br><br>"It may sound simple, but etymology -- the study of word origins -- is in fact murky and tedious, if unfailingly fascinating. Liberman's book is an examination of the process of determining how a word originated, and it shows how complex his craft can be."--Chicago Tribune</p><h2>501 German Verbs (501 Verbs Series)</h2><p>From &#x160;chzen (to groan) to ziehen (to pull), 501 of the most commonly used German verbs are presented alphabetically with translations.

This anthology facilitates that readership. Its lucid introduction and careful selection of texts and contexts adumbrate key topics in Cavendish studies, and its potential to enrich courses on early modern literature, the history of science, and gender studies is great." - Anna Battigelli, SUNY, Plattsburgh<p> Margaret Cavendish was one of the most subversive and entertaining writers of the seventeenth century. She invented new genres, challenged gender roles, and critiqued the new science as well as the mores of society. "Paper Bodies" was the wonderful phrase she used to described her manuscripts, which she hoped would continue to make "a great Blazing Light" after her death. There are connections here to Cavendish's most famous work, <em>The Description of a New World, Called the Blazing World</em> (1666), a unique tale of a woman travelling through the north pole to a strange new world. </p> <p> In addition to <em>The Blazing World</em>, this volume includes Cavendish's brief autobiography, <em>A True Relation of My Birth, Breeding and Life</em> (1667), her play<em> The Convent of Pleasure</em>, and selections from her <em>Sociable Letters</em>, her poetry, and her critical writings. A variety of background documents by other seventeenth-century writers helps to set her work in context for the modern reader. </p></p><h2>Strategic Management: Theory: An Integrated Approach</h2><p>This comprehensive and engaging text presents the complexities of strategic management through up-to-date scholarship and hands-on applications.

Focusing first on analysis at the scale of a single watershed, they then introduce the mechanics of fluids in closed conduits and open channels. They reevaluate catchment processes in light of fluid mechanics, open channel hydraulics, and groundwater flow. In a concluding chapter, they stress the importance of understanding water movement in the environment by exploring the relationship of hydrology to such disciplines as atmospheric science, ecology, and geology. </p><p>Accompanying the book is a CD-ROM, which provides a Web version of the text (Netscape Navigator 2.0 or later required).

Siegfried Kracauer--a prominent German film critic and member of Walter Benjamin's and Theodor Adorno's intellectual circle--broke new ground in exploring the connections between film aesthetics, the prevailing psychological state of Germans in the Weimar era, and the evolving social and political reality of the time. Kracauer's pioneering book, which examines German history from 1921 to 1933 in light of such movies as <i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, M, Metropolis</i>, and <i>The Blue Angel</i>, has never gone out of print. Now, over half a century after its first appearance, this beautifully designed and entirely new edition reintroduces Kracauer for the twenty-first century. Film scholar Leonardo Quaresima places Kracauer in context in a critical introduction, and updates the book further with a new bibliography, index, and list of inaccuracies that crept into the first edition. This volume is a must-have for the film historian, film theorist, or cinema enthusiast.</p><br><p>In <i>From Caligari to Hitler</i>, Siegfried Kracauer made a startling (and still controversial) claim: films as a popular art provide insight into the unconscious motivations and fantasies of a nation. In films of the 1920s, he traced recurring visual and narrative tropes that expressed, he argued, a fear of chaos and a desire for order, even at the price of authoritarian rule. The book has become an undisputed classic of film historiography, laying the foundations for the serious study of film.</p><br><p>Kracauer was an important film critic in Weimar Germany. A Jew, he escaped the rise of Nazism, fleeing to Paris in 1933. Later, in anguish after Benjamin's suicide, he made his way to New York, where he remained until his death in 1966. He wrote <i>From Caligari to Hitler</i> while working as a "special assistant" to the curator of the Museum of Modern Art's film division. He was also on the editorial board of Bollingen Series. Despite many critiques of its attempt to link movies to historical outcomes, <i>From Caligari to Hitler</i> remains Kracauer's best-known and most influential book, and a seminal work in the study of film. Princeton published a revised edition of his <i>Theory of Film: The Redemption of Physical Reality in 1997</i>.</p></p><p><p>"An undisputed classic of modern film historiography, Kracauer's <i>From Caligari to Hitler</i> had a major impact on the way we relate movies to history and society. Although Kracauer is not afraid of using such contested concepts as collective psychology and German 'soul,' his productive readings of Weimar films as harbingers of emerging fascism still resonate today. Leonardo Quaresima's engaging and erudite introduction is critical in situating Kracauer's project both in its historical moment and in our time."<b>--Anton Kaes, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><b>Siegfried Kracauer</b> (1889-1966) was a film critic and independent film historian and theorist.

Using a hidden camera and under difficult circumstances, Vishniac was able to take over sixteen thousand photographs; most were left with his father in a village in France for the duration of the war. With the publication of <i>Children of a Vanished World</i>, seventy of those photographs are available, thirty-six for the first time. The book is devoted to a subject Vishniac especially loved, and one whose mystery and spontaneity he captured with particular poignancy: children.<br><br>Selected and edited by the photographer's daughter, Mara Vishniac Kohn, and translator and coeditor Miriam Hartman Flacks, these images show children playing, children studying, children in the midst of a world that was about to disappear. They capture the daily life of their subjects, at once ordinary and extraordinary. The photographs are accompanied by a selection of nursery rhymes, songs, poems, and chants for children's games in both Yiddish and English translation. Thanks to Vishniac's visual artistry and the editors' choice of traditional Yiddish verses, a part of this wonderful culture can be preserved for future generations.<br><br>Earlier books of Roman Vishniac's photographs include <i>To Give Them Light: The Legacy of Roman Vishniac</i> (1995), <i>A Vanished World</i> (1983), and <i>Polish Jews</i> (1947).<br><br>A major exhibition titled "Children of a Vanished World: Photographs byRoman Vishniac" is scheduled at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York. The show will open to the public on March 7 and run through June 4, 2000.</p><p>"Vishniac came back from his trips to Eastern Europe in the 1930s with a collection of photographs that has become an important historical document, for it gives a last-minute look at the human beings he photographed just before the fury of Nazi brutality exterminated them. Vishniac took with him on this self-imposed assignment--besides this or that kind of camera and film--a rare depth of understanding and a native son's warmth and love for his people. The resulting photographs are among photography's finest documents of a time and place."--Edward Steichen<p>"Not to forget, not to allow oblivion to defeat memory: That is his obsession. Defying all dangers, surmounting all obstacles, he travels from province to province, from village to village, capturing slums and markets, a gesture here, a movement there, reflections of hope and despair, so that the victims will not wholly vanish into the abyss--so that they will live on, past torture and past massacre. And he has won the wager: They live still."--Elie Wiesel</p><b>Mara Vishniac Kohn</b> is an educational therapist who has spent most of her professional life in private special education. <b>Miriam Hartman Flacks</b>, a Brooklyn-born native Yiddish speaker, seeks to preserve the rich tradition of Yiddish folksongs.</p><h2>How to Draw Caricatures</h2><p><p>Includes hundreds of step-by-step instructions and examples of caricatured subjects that show the art in action.</p></p><p>The entertaining art of caricature is made simple in this delightfully informative book.McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>Green Team (Rogue Warrior, Book 3)</h2><p>The Green Team, a top-secret unit of the U.S. Navy, battles internal as well as external enemies in a dangerous test of their skills that involves a transnational terror network based in a violent religious organization. Tour.</p><p><p>The revelations from Richard Marcinko -- the fearlessly controversial Navy commando -- in his explosive #1 bestselling autobiography, <i>Rogue Warrior</i>, reverberated through the highest levels of the U.S. government. From his exploits leading SEAL TEAM SIX, the most effective and highly secret counterterrorist unit in the world, to his missions penetrating the Navy's most secure installations, Marcinko brought real-life adventure to a new level. But, bound by government restrictions, Marcinko was forbidden to tell the whole story. The answer was fiction -- <i>Rogue Warrior: Red Cell</i>, the take-no-prisoners bestseller with Marcinko as hero. Now the Rogue Warrior's back and he's hotter than ever, in a knockout novel of courage and nonstop action. </p><p>Under deep coverf, on direct orders from the Oval Office, the Rogue Warrior and his GREEN TEAM of U.S. Navy SEALs have slipped overseas to snatch a terrorist and bring him to justice in an American courtroom. But events divert him to another mission. In Portsmouth, England, an aircraft carrier has been sabotaged. Thirty-six are killed -- including the British Admiral of the Fleet, and the American Chief of Naval Operations, one of the few friends the Rogue Warrior had left in the Navy. Marcinko elbows his way onto the case, where he discovers a SEAL's worst nightmare: a transnational terror network in the making, and no one paying attention. A holy war is brewing -- en elusive, modern-day Saladin, whose hunger for power is matched by his cruel genius, has taken control of a vast, violent religious movement that is encircling the globe, growing in strength, and lethally zeroing in on the West. </p><p>Defeating that global menace will be the supreme test of Marcinko's deadly GREEN TEAM, a top-secret unit that operates outside the U.S. military's chain of command. But others don't want Marcinko and his SEALs prowling and growling where they could actually do some good. Missions are compromised. Men die. Secrets are leaked. Governments are embarrassed. In London and in Washington, the political and military wolves look for a sacrificial lam -- and its Dick Marcinko they select for the slaughter. </p><p>For the Rogue Warrior -- always a renegade and now a fugitive -- it's time to declare a holy war of his own. The enemy may have the ultimate weapon of terror, but the men of the GREEN TEAM has Marcinko's Tenth Commandment of SpecWar: There Are No Rules -- Thou Shalt Win at All Cost! </p>The Rogue Warrior is back with a vengeance in this third adventure starring and narrated by foul-mouthed, fast-talking ex-SEAL Richard Marcinko, subject of the autobiographical Rogue Warrior and hero of the novel Rogue Warrior II: Red Cell. Marcinko's latest escapade opens with his new Green Team on a secret assignment from the Chief of Naval Operations to snatch a terrorist away from his Cairo hideaway. When a terrorist bomb kills Marcinko's mentor and friend, CNO Arleigh Secrest, Marcinko and team vow revenge. Their battle against traitors and terrorists is waged with high-energy heroics from Nice to Karachi, with enough testosterone to float a battleship. Marcinko gives new definition to the word tough; the character that he and coauthor Weisman have created to tell the story is loud, self-assured, self-aware and unabashedly chauvinistic? the embodiment of an American myth: the outlaw who gets the job done with an end-justifies-the-means morality. The highly energetic storytelling includes numerous informational, historical and anecdotal asides, none of which is dull. A novel for those who like in-your-face four-letter action.

Dr. Brown highlights the often unrecognized role that emotions play in this complex disorder. He explains why even very bright people with ADHD get stuck because they can focus well on some tasks that interest them, but often can't focus adequately on other important tasks and relationships.</p> <ul> <li>The first book to explain and illustrate the crucial role of emotions in the daily functioning of those living with ADHD</li> <li>Brown, Associate Director of the Yale Clinic for Attention &amp; Related Disorders, is an internationally known authority on ADHD</li> </ul> <p>Drawing on the latest research findings, the book describes strategies and treatments for getting "unstuck" to move on to a more rewarding and productive life.</p></p><p>Thomas Brown <p><b></b></p> <b>Nine Things You Might Not Know About ADHD by Thomas E. Brown, Ph. D.</b> <p></p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <p>Despite decades of research into the condition known as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, many myths still persist. In "Smart But Stuck" I share stories of past clients who were extremely intelligent, yet got &#x201c;stuck&#x201d; at school, work, or in personal relationships because of their ADHD. These stories illustrate how emotions--both positive and negative--impact individuals with ADHD, and the steps those with ADHD can take to get &#x201c;unstuck. &#x201d;</p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <br> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <ul> <li> Emotions like anger, fear, shame, or hopelessness can take over the mind of a person with ADHD, much like a computer virus takes over a hard drive. This flooding of negative emotion makes it difficult for the person to keep any other feelings in mind--feelings that would help them to deal with the situation at hand, such as remembering that the person they are so frustrated with is also someone they love and don&#x2019;t really want to hurt.</li> <li>ADHD often looks like a simple lack of willpower because those with the disorder can focus well on a few specific activities that strongly interest them, yet have chronic difficulty focusing on other important tasks and activities. Evidence shows clearly that ADHD is not due to a lack of willpower--it&#x2019;s a problem in the dynamics of brain chemistry. </li> <li> Persons with ADHD not only have problems managing negative emotions like anger; they also struggle to manage positive emotions like excitement and intense interest. An inability to manage positive emotions can be just as problematic.</li> <li> Some extremely bright students with ADHD fail in high school or college not due to a lack of intelligence, but because unrecognized emotional problems with fear, shame, or depression lead them to avoid going to classes, getting their work done, and sustaining friendships.</li> <li> Parents of a child with ADHD are often extremely stressed and may become polarized against each other. Typically one parent assumes the role of &#x201c;butt kicker,&#x201d; confronting the child each time he or she isn&#x2019;t doing what is expected, while the other parent acts as the &#x201c;marshmallow,&#x201d; repeatedly making excuses for inappropriate behavior.</li> <li> As some women approach menopause they develop ADHD-like symptoms of inattention and memory problems. These symptoms--which often cause fears of Alzheimer&#x2019;s--are sometimes improved with ADHD medications.</li> <li> Emotional problems of those with ADHD involve not only &#x201c;putting the brakes on&#x201d; emotions like anger or frustration. They also involve problems with &#x201c;stepping on the gas&#x201d; or ignition--the ability to overcome lethargy and procrastination to get started on necessary tasks.</li> <li> It&#x2019;s often difficult for teens and adults with ADHD to feel strong enough motivation and feel it consistently enough to perform tasks where the payoff is further down the road (i. e. , where gratification is delayed).</li> <li> Recent research shows that a sizeable percentage of people with ADHD also suffer from significant problems in social relationships that are associated with Asperger&#x2019;s syndrome or other autism spectrum disorders.</li> </ul><p><b>Smart but Stuck</b> offers a series of true stories about intelligent, capable teens and adults who have gotten &#x201c;stuck&#x201d; at school or work, or in social relationships because of their ADHD. These moving and sometimes surprising case histories illustrate the many facets of the disorder and detail strategies and treatments those with ADHD can use to get &#x201c;unstuck.&#x201d;</p> <p>In these pages you&#x2019;ll meet ...</p> <ul> <li><b>Sue</b>, who earned good grades until middle school, then lost motivation for schoolwork. Now in 9th grade, she&#x2019;s frustrating teachers and family while losing hope for herself.</li> <li><b>Mike</b>, a college student who recently found himself on academic probation. His dad has always told him he&#x2019;s smart but just lazy, and now he&#x2019;s starting to believe it.</li> <li><b>Steve</b>, a computer programmer whose ADHD struggles have led to him losing his job&#x2014;and his wife. He&#x2019;s good at programming computers, but not at programming himself.</li> <li><b>Sarah</b>, who&#x2019;s had trouble keeping track of things and getting work done since she hit menopause. She never had such a hard time when she was younger.</li> </ul> <p>Dr. Thomas Brown, an internationally known authority on ADHD, highlights the often-unrecognized role that emotions play in this complex disorder. And it&#x2019;s not just negative emotions. As Brown shows, those with ADHD also have a hard time managing <i>positive</i> emotions about certain interests and activities, making it hard for them to shift gears and pay attention to immediate needs and responsibilities. Brown offers an updated view of ADHD and explains why even very bright people with ADHD can get stuck, struggling to motivate themselves for important tasks. He demonstrates why many with ADHD can have laser-like focus for some tasks while finding it difficult to concentrate on others. Above all, Brown details paths that people with ADHD can take to move on toward a more rewarding and productive life.</p></p><h2>Ada Lovelace: My First Ada Lovelace (Volume 10) (Little People, BIG DREAMS, 10)</h2><p><b>This board book version of <i>Ada Lovelace</i>&#x2014;an international bestseller from the beloved Little People, BIG DREAMS series&#x2014;introduces the youngest dreamers to the world's first computer programmer.</b><br><br> As a child, Ada had a big imagination and a talent for mathematics.

Recall a front stoop, juke joint, funeral, wedding, barbershop, kitchen: the music, noise, communal energy, and release. Dream. Participate the way you do when you allow a song to transport you, all kinds of songs, from hip-hop rap to Bach to Monk, each bearing its different history of sounds and silences."<p></p><p>-- From the Foreword by John Edgar Wideman</p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p>African-American folklore was Zora Neale Hurston's first love. Collected in the late 1920s, <em>Every Tongue Got to Confess</em> is the third volume of folk-tales from the celebrated author of <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God.</em> It is published here for the first time.</p><p>These hilarious, bittersweet, often saucy folk-tales -- some of which date back to the Civil War -- provide a fascinating, verdant slice of African-American life in the rural South at the turn of the twentieth century. Arranged according to subject -- from God Tales, Preacher Tales, and Devil Tales to Heaven Tales, White-Folk Tales, and Mistaken Identity Tales -- they reveal attitudes about slavery, faith, race relations, family, and romance that have been passed on for generations. They capture the heart and soul of the vital, independent, and creative community that so inspired Zora Neale Hurston.</p><p>In the foreword, author John Edgar Wideman discusses the impact of Hurston's pioneering effort to preserve the African-American oral tradition and shows readers how to read these folk tales in the historical and literary context that has -- and has not -- changed over the years. And in the introduction, Hurston scholar Carla Kaplan explains how these folk-tales were collected, lost, and found, and examines their profound significance today.</p><p>In <em>Every Tongue Got to Confess,</em> Zora Neale Hurston records, with uncanny precision, the voices of ordinary people and pays tribute to the richness of Black vernacular -- its crisp self-awareness, singular wit, and improvisational wordplay. These folk-tales reflect the joys and sorrows of the African-American experience, celebrate the redemptive power of storytelling, and showcase the continuous presence in America of an Africanized language that flourishes to this day.</p></p><p><p>Zora Neale Hurston was a novelist, folklorist, and anthropologist. An author of four novels (<em>Jonah&#x2019;s Gourd Vine</em>, 1934; <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em>, 1937; <em>Moses, Man of the Mountain</em>, 1939; and <em>Seraph on the Suwanee</em>, 1948); two books of folklore (<em>Mules and Men</em>, 1935, and <em>Tell My Horse</em>, 1938); an autobiography (<em>Dust Tracks on a Road</em>, 1942); and over fifty short stories, essays, and plays. She attended Howard University, Barnard College and Columbia University, and was a graduate of Barnard College in 1927. She was born on January 7, 1891, in Notasulga, Alabama, and grew up in Eatonville, Florida. She died in Fort Pierce, in 1960.&nbsp; In 1973, Alice Walker had a headstone placed at her gravesite with this epitaph: &#x201c;Zora Neale Hurston: A Genius of the South.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>Traveling alone through the southern United States in the early part of the twentieth century, Barnard scholar Zora Neale Hurston meticulously collected the stories and anecdotes told by this country's African Americans. Her work, recorded word by word in transcripts, lay largely unpublished for decades. Now Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis bring it to life in a stunning audio production that captures the richness of the language as well as the culture behind the stories. Listening to their performance is like listening to the original story-tellers sharing "lies" with friends on a warm summer evening. Given the spoken nature of folklore, theexcellent audio rendition can only improve on the original written publication. A foreword by John Edgar Wideman and an introduction by Carla Kaplan provide fascinating insight into both the collection and the recording of the stories, as well as their place in African-American history. A cultural treasure.

Covey presents a practical and philosophical guide to solving the problems--large and small, mundane and extraordinary--that confront all families and strong communities. By offering revealing anecdotes about ordinary people as well as helpful suggestions about changing everyday behavior, <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Families</i> shows how and why to have family meetings, the importance of keeping promises, how to balance individual and family needs, and how to move from dependence to interdependence. <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Families</i> is an invaluable guidebook to the welfare of families everywhere.<br></p><p>"What is 'effectiveness' in a family?" asks author Steven R. Covey. He promptly answers with four words: "a beautiful family culture." Building this culture is the primary theme of Covey's parenting guide, a manual based on concepts introduced in his blockbuster, <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i>. Covey, a New-Age business guru and leadership authority, has consulted with the world's top corporate and political leaders, but closer to home he is the father of nine children. Here, Covey reinterprets each of his now famous "habits" (Habit 1: Be Proactive, Habit 4: Think Win-Win, Habit 6: Synergize) to apply to parenting and family-life issues. Covey suggests writing a family mission statement, implementing special family times and "one-on-ones," holding regular family meetings, and making the commitment to move from "me" to "we" as techniques to improve family effectiveness. Covey is a brilliant storyteller. By weaving the voices and anecdotes of his wife and children with his own inspirational and informative stories, exercises, and parables, he has created a book with something for all parents interested in enhancing the strength and beauty of their own families. <i>--Ericka Lutz</i>Steven R.

The sleepers aroused themselves, and we all stood up, putting on a startled look, as if we had been buried in our work.</p><p>The Head motioned to us to sit down.</p><p>'Monsieur Roger,' said he in a quiet tone to the prep master, I've brought you a new boy. He's going into the second. If his conduct and progress are satisfactory, he will be put up with the boys of his own age. '</p><p>The new boy had kept in the background, in the corner behind the door, almost out of sight. He was a country lad of about fifteen, and taller than any of us. His hair was clipped straight across the forehead, like a village choirboy's. He seemed a decent enough fellow, but horribly nervous. Although he was not broad across the shoulders, his green cloth jacket, with its black buttons, looked as if it pinched him under the arms and revealed, protruding well beyond the cuffs, a pair of raw, bony wrists, obviously not unaccustomed to exposure. His legs, encased in blue stockings, issued from a pair of drab-coloured breeches, very tightly braced. He had on a pair of thick, clumsy shoes, not particularly well cleaned and plentifully fortified with nails.</p><p>The master began to hear the boys at their work. The newcomer listened with all his ears, drinking it in as attentively as if he had been in church, not daring to cross his legs or to lean his elbows on the desk, and when two o'clock came and the bell rang for dismissal, the master had to call him back to earth and tell him to line up with the rest of us.</p><p>It was our custom, when we came in to class, to throw our caps on the floor, in order to have our hands free. As soon as ever we got inside the door, we 'buzzed' them under the form, against the wall, so as to kick up plenty of dust. That was supposed to be 'the thing.' Whether he failed to notice this manoeuvre or whether he was too shy to join in it, it is impossible to say, but when prayers were over he was still nursing his cap. That cap belonged to the composite order of headgear, and in it the heterogeneous characteristics of the busby, the Polish shapska, the bowler, the otterskin toque and the cotton nightcap were simultaneously represented. It was, in short, one of those pathetic objects whose mute unloveliness conveys the infinitely wistful expression we may sometimes note on the face of an idiot. Ovoid in form and stiffened with whalebone, it began with a sort of triple line of sausage-shaped rolls running all round its circumference; next, separated by a red band, came alternate patches of velvet and rabbit-skin; then a kind of bag or sack which culminated in a stiffened polygon elaborately embroidered, whence, at the end of a long, thin cord, hung a ball made out of gold wire, by way of a tassel. The cap was brand-new, and the peak of it all shiny.</p><p>'Stand up,' said the master.</p><p>He stood up, and down went his cap. The whole class began to laugh.</p><p>He bent down to recover it. One of the boys next to him jogged him with his elbow and knocked it down again. Again he stooped to pick it up.</p><p>'You may discard your helmet,' said the master, who had a pretty wit.</p><p>A shout of laughter from the rest of the class quite put the poor fellow out of countenance, and so flustered was he that he didn't know whether to keep it in his hand, put it on the floor or stick it on his head. He sat down and deposited it on his knees.</p><p>'Stand up,' said the master again, 'and tell me your name.'</p><p>In mumbling tones the new boy stammered out something quite unintelligible.</p><p>'Again!'</p><p>Again came the inarticulate mumble, drowned by the shouts of the class.</p><p>'Louder!' rapped out the master sharply. 'Speak up!'</p><p>Whereupon the boy, in desperation, opened his jaws as wide as they would go and, with the full force of his lungs, as though he were hailing somebody at a distance, fired off the word 'Charbovari.'</p><p>In an instant the class was in an uproar. The din grew louder and louder, a ceaseless crescendo crested with piercing yells--they shrieked, they howled, they stamped their feet, bellowing at the top of their voices: 'Charbovari! Charbovari!' Then, after a while, the storm began to subside. There would be sporadic outbreaks from time to time, smothered by a terrific effort, or perhaps a titter would fizz along a whole row, or a stifled explosion sputter out here and there, like a half-extinguished fuse.</p><p>However, beneath a hail of 'impositions,' order was gradually restored. The master--who had had it dictated, spelled out and read over to him--had at length succeeded in getting hold of the name of Charles Bovary, and forthwith he ordered the hapless wretch to go and sit on the dunce's stool, immediately below the seat of authority. He started to obey, stopped short and stood hesitating.</p><p>'What are you looking for?' said the master.</p><p>'My ca--' began the new boy timidly, casting an anxious glance around him.</p><p>An angry shout of 'Five hundred lines for the whole class' checked, like the <i>Quos ego,</i> a fresh outburst. 'Stop your noise, then, will you?' continued the master indignantly, mopping his brow with a handkerchief which he had produced from the interior of his cap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>The Conquest of Plassans (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p><strong>'Abbe Faujas has arrived!'</strong><br><br>The arrival of Abbe Faujas in the provincial town of Plassans has profound consequences for the community, and for the family of Fran�ois Mouret in particular.

Although custodian and unlicensed PI Ezekiel "Easy" Rawlins stayed safely inside during the turmoil, as an African-American male he understands all too well what it was about. "It's hot and people are mad," he explains in Walter Mosley's <i>Little Scarlet</i>. "They&#x2019;ve been mad since they were babies." Even with the rioting finally cooled, police remain on edge. So when a mid-30s, redheaded black woman named Nola Payne--aka "Little Scarlet"--turns up dead in her apartment, strangled and shot and showing signs of recent sexual contact, the cops are reluctant to storm L.A.'s minority community, looking for her murderer, especially since the culprit may well be an injured white man Payne had sheltered, and who's now disappeared. Instead, they ask Easy to see what he can find out about this crime.<p> The case forces Rawlins to address the ethnic tribulations of 1960s America, in microcosm, and his own discomfort with discrimination, in particular.</p><p> </p><blockquote> I spent my whole early life at the back of buses and in the segregated balconies at theaters. I had been arrested for walking in the wrong part of town and threatened for looking a man in the eye. And when I went to war to fight for freedom, I found myself in a segregated army, treated with less respect than they treated German POWs. I had seen people who looked like me jeered on TV and in the movies. I had had enough and I wasn't about to turn back, even though I wanted to. </blockquote><p> But Easy can't tackle this investigation alone; assisting him are the casually homicidal Raymond "Mouse" Alexander, as well as a dogged white detective and a fetching younger woman, who threatens to overturn the settled life Easy has been working toward all these years. Nor can Rawlins wrap the case up easily. Harassed and attacked for his inquiries, he eventually connects Payne's slaying to a homeless man, allegedly responsible for killing as many as 21 black women, all of whom had the bad judgment to hook up with white men.</p><p> <i>Little Scarlet</i>, the eighth Rawlins novel (after <i>Bad Boy Brawly Brown</i>), is unusual for Mosley, because it focuses as much on the credible mechanics of crime-solving as it does on the exposition of character and the exploration of L.A.'s mid-20th-century black culture. Combined with the author's vigorous prose and prowess with dialogue, Easy's promotion to serious sleuth promises great things for what was already a standout series. <i>--J.

His books include <i>Idols of the Marketplace</i> (2001) and <i>Ideology</i> (second edition, 2003), and he has contributed articles to <i>The Nation</i>, the<i> Times Literary Supplement</i>, and the <i>Journal of the History of Ideas</i>.&nbsp;<b>From David Hawkes&#x2019;s Introduction to <i>Paradise Lost</i></b><br>Milton believed that the kind of knowledge that can be attained by the human mind was necessarily contingent, or limited. It was limited by cultural and historical context: The ancient Greeks, for example, had been culturally unable to arrive at monotheism. But it was also <i>inherently</i> limited by its internal properties. The human mind is designed, or has developed, in such a way as to live in time and space. To exist outside time and space, the human mind would have to become something different than what it currently is. The same goes for such ideas as causality or extension; without the capacity to think according to these categories it would be simply impossible to have any kind of recognizably human experience. We do not, therefore, experience the world as it really is, we experience the world as it appears to human beings. And we know that this experience is contingent upon&#x2014;limited by&#x2014;the inherent nature of the human mind.<br>It follows that the concepts we form of things, the way they appear to us, do not correspond to the things in themselves. There are thus two kinds of truth: the truth &#x201c;for us,&#x201d; in what modern philosophers call the world of &#x201c;phenomena,&#x201d; and the truth &#x201c;in itself,&#x201d; in what is known as the world of &#x201c;noumena.&#x201d; In John Keats&#x2019;s &#x201c;Ode on a Grecian Urn,&#x201d; for example, the poet laments that he can never experience the urn in its noumenal state, as it is in itself. Keats comes to this realization by considering the difference between the significance it possesses for him, as a modern Englishman, and the meanings it conveyed to its creator, an ancient Greek. The &#x201c;phenomenal&#x201d; appearance of the urn has changed, although the urn &#x201c;in itself&#x201d; has not. In a sense the noumenal is more true, because it is more absolute, than the phenomenal, but the truth &#x201c;in itself&#x201d; is by definition beyond the grasp of human thought. We are stuck with a consciousness that we know to be incomplete. This is philosophical terminology, but Milton expresses the same ideas in quasi-mythological, religious terms. <i>Paradise Lost</i> hinges upon the fundamental, unbridgeable, qualitative distinction between the world of earthly phenomena as experienced by Adam and Eve (and also by the poem&#x2019;s all-too-human narrator), and the world of spiritual noumena as it is represented to them (and us) through the intricate system of characters, figures, and images that make up the Western mythological and religious traditions.<br>Above all, Milton insists on the disparity in nature between the Creator and His creation. <i>Paradise Lost</i> describes the alienation of labor in a cosmic context; it tells of how the universe that God made came to be alien to Him, and how it came to seem autonomous and self-generating to its inhabitants. The disjunction between the Maker and the made involves a contradiction between two different kinds of value, of significance. It follows that any knowledge we can have of God or His Providential designs must always be &#x201c;mediated,&#x201d; translated into the contingent terms and concepts to which the human mind has access.<br>Almost half of <i>Paradise Lost </i>consists of stories told to Adam and/or Eve through the voices of the archangels Raphael and Michael. These characters incessantly remind their auditors that they are attempting the impossible task of representing noumena in terms of phenomena. Asked to describe the fall of Satan to the human couple, Raphael falls into a quandry: &#x201c;how shall I relate / To human sense th&#x2019;invisible exploits / Of warring spirits&#x201d; (5.564&#x2013;566). He decides that he must tell his story in the form of an extended metaphor, using images that Adam and Eve are equipped to understand: &#x201c;what surmounts the reach / Of human sense, I shall delineate so, / By likening spiritual to corporal forms, / As may express then best&#x201d; (5.571&#x2013;574). We are thus warned not to take the action of the &#x201c;war in Heaven&#x201d; that the angel describes literally, but to remain conscious that we are receiving figural representations of spiritual (we might call them psychological or philosophical) events. We can only understand those events if we take account of the fact that they are mediated for us through contingent human discourse: <br><br>Immediate are the acts of God, more swift <br><br>Than time or motion; but to human ears <br><br>Cannot without process of speech be told, <br><br>So told as earthly notion can receive (7.176&#x2013;179). <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>The action of <i>Paradise Lost</i> takes place, then, in many different registers simultaneously. The ability to read a text as both literal and symbolic, and also at infinite gradations between these poles, came more naturally to educated people in Milton&#x2019;s time than it does to us, trained as they were in the intricate hermeneutics of biblical exegesis. Furthermore, their facility with textual interpretation was matched by a happy disregard for the boundaries between what we regard as mutually exclusive intellectual fields. <i>Paradise Lost</i> is certainly a work of theology, representing the spiritual conflict between metaphysical beings, but this conflict is also the determining factor in world history, as well as within the human psyche. Although more than twenty characters address us in the course of the poem, such figures also represent disputing forces within Milton&#x2019;s mind and, by implication, within the mind of the reader.</p><h2>Essentials of International Economics</h2><p>Expanding beyond the traditional focus on advanced companies to cover emerging markets and developing economies,<em> Essentials of International Economics</em> takes a modern approach to make the material more accessible.</p><p><b>Robert C.

He attended school in N�zhin and gained a reputation for his theatrical abilities. He went to St Petersburg in 1829 and with the help of a friend gained a post in one of the government ministries. Gogol was introduced to Zhukovsky, the romantic poet, and to Pushkin, and with the publication of <b>Evenings on a Farm near Dikanka</b>(1831) he had an entr�e to all the leading literary salons. He even managed for a short period to be Professor of History at the University of St. Petersburg (1834-5).</p> <p><b>Diary of a Madman</b> and <b>The Story of the Quarrel between Ivan Ivanovich and Ivan Nikiforovich</b> appeared in 1934, <b>The Nose</b> in 1836, and <b>The Overcoat</b> in 1842. Gogol also wrote the play <b>The Inspector</b> (1836), <b>Dead Souls</b> (1842), and several moralizing essays defending the Tsarist regime, to the horror of his liberal and radical friends. He lived a great deal abroad, mostly in Rome, and in his last years became increasingly prey to religious mania and despair. He made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1848, but was bitterly disappointed in the lack of feeling that the journey kindled. He returned to Russia and fell under the influence of a spiritual director who told him to destroy his writings as they were sinful. He burned the second part of <b>Dead Souls</b>, and died in 1852 after subjecting himself to a severe regime of fasting.</p>The title loony, an obsessive petty bureaucrat, first saw the literary light of day in 1835, when his creator, Russia's first great fiction writer, was gaining his initial renown. Backed up by percussion instruments, Stephen Ouimette impersonates him here in a Stratford Festival staged reading, which was recorded by the CBC in Toronto. By and large, the story satirizes the officialdom of the time and place, but Ouimette, while doing his best with humor that has gotten a bit stale, chillingly plays his character's descent into madness. A fine performance.

Indeed, many wonder if Vermeer employed a camera obscura, a primitive form of camera, to enhance his realistic effects?<br> In <em>Vermeer's Camera</em>, Philip Steadman traces the development of the camera obscura--first described by Leonaro da Vinci--weighs the arguments that scholars have made for and against Vermeer's use of the camera, and offers a fascinating examination of the paintings themselves and what they alone can tell us of Vermeer's technique. Vermeer left no record of his method and indeed we know almost nothing of the man nor of how he worked. But by a close and illuminating study of the paintings Steadman concludes that Vermeer did use the camera obscura and shows how the inherent defects in this primitive device enabled Vermeer to achieve some remarkable effects--the slight blurring of image, the absence of sharp lines, the peculiar illusion not of closeness but of distance in the domestic scenes. Steadman argues that the use of the camera also explains some previously unexplainable qualities of Vermeer's art, such as the absence of conventional drawing, the pattern of underpainting in areas of pure tone, the pervasive feeling of reticence that suffuses his canvases, and the almost magical sense that Vermeer is painting not objects but light itself. <br> Drawing on a wealth of Vermeer research and displaying an extraordinary sensitivity to the subtleties of the work itself, Philip Steadman offers in <em>Vermeer's Camera</em> a fresh perspective on some of the most enchanting paintings ever created.<br></p><p>Philip Steadman's remarkable book <i>Vermeer's Camera</i> cracks an artistic enigma that has haunted art history for centuries. Over the years, artists and art historians have marveled at the extraordinary visual realism of the paintings of the 17th-century Dutch painter Jan Vermeer. The painter's spectacular <i>View of Delft</i>, painted around 1661, and the beautiful domestic interior <i>The Music Lesson</i> seem almost photographic in their incredible detail and precise perspective. Since the 19th century, experts have speculated that Vermeer used a camera obscura, an early precursor of the modern camera. However, conclusive proof was never discovered, until now. In <i>Vermeer's Camera</i>, Steadman proves that Vermeer did indeed use a camera obscura to complete his greatest canvases. Part art-historical study, part scientific argument, but mainly a fascinating detective story, <i>Vermeer's Camera</i> argues: <blockquote>Vermeer had a camera obscura with a lens at the painting's viewpoint. He used this arrangement to project the scene onto the back wall of the room, which thus served as the camera's screen. He put paper on the wall and traced, perhaps even painted from the projected image. It is because Vermeer traced these images that they are the same size as the paintings themselves.</blockquote> Steadman painstakingly develops his argument through careful study of the history of the camera obscura, an exploration of 17th-century optics, and a detailed study of the light, optics, perspective, and measurement of a series of Vermeer's paintings. He goes to remarkable lengths to reconstruct Vermeer's studio and its furnishings, down to the angle of the light from its windows. The science is complex, but always clearly explained. This is not an attempt to reveal Vermeer as an artistic "cheat." Steadman convincingly argues that "Vermeer's obsessions with light, tonal values, shadow, and colour, for the treatment of which his work is so admired, are very closely bound up with his study of the special qualities of optical images." <i>Vermeer's Camera</i> is a wonderful book that shows the ways in which, during the 17th century, art and science went hand in hand. It offers an enlarged, rather than reduced, perspective on Vermeer. <i>--Jerry Brotton. Amazon.co.uk</i>Controversy about Vermeer's use of the camera obscura <p>The suggestion that Vermeer might have employed some optical device as an aid to painting is more than a hundred years old. From the 1890s up to the 1980s a broad consensus built amongst Vermeer scholars, that the artist seems likely to have made use of the camera obscura - though the exact details of this technique remained uncertain. The notion was investigated experimentally by Seymour, Fink and Wheelock. Meanwhile the implications for Vermeer's style were explored by several critics, outstanding among them the poet Paul Claudel, the painter Lawrence Gowing in his monograph on Vermeer of 1952, and the historian Svetlana Alpers in The Art of Describing (1983). There were dissenting voices, certainly - as for example Swillens, who argued that Vermeer used geometrical perspective methods - and other critics for whom the issue was unimportant. But the majority view supported the idea that Vermeer was a camera user. </p><p>In the 1990s this consensus was broken. The catalogue of the big Vermeer exhibition held in Washington and The Hague in 1995/96 mentioned the camera briefly, but claimed that Vermeer 'did not trace the image' directly. Much more space was devoted to an article by J�rgen Wadum, curator at The Hague, proposing that the artist relied instead on conventional mathematical perspective procedures. Since then several authors have been quite insistent that Vermeer did not use the camera. For example a volume of Vermeer Studies, published by Yale in 1998, contained an article on the camera obscura by Jean-Luc Delsaute, who concluded: "it seems rash to continue to believe that the camera was one of the tools with which [Vermeer] worked." </p><p>The position of Arthur Wheelock, principal curator of the 1995/96 exhibition, and author of many books on Vermeer, appears to have evolved. In his doctoral thesis of 1973 he was enthusiastic about the camera theory. More recently he seems to have become dubious, believing that although Vermeer might have been familiar with the instrument, and might even have mimicked its effects on occasion, he certainly did not trace large parts of his paintings from camera images. Instead he set up his perspectives, Wheelock believes, in the same way as contemporary Dutch architectural painters: ' a rough sketch, a construction drawing and then the final composition.' </p><p>This scepticism seems to arise out of distaste for the very idea that Vermeer might have been guilty of what is still regarded as a form of cheating. (Vermeer's Camera argues that this view is misplaced and historically irrelevant in the case of Vermeer.) Another reason for doubt is that most previous arguments for Vermeer's use of the camera have been founded on minor idiosyncrasies of his painting style. Otherwise the use of the instrument would have left no obvious trace. No documentary evidence of any kind survives about Vermeer's working methods, no drawings from his hand, no clear-cut results from x-ray analysis of the canvases. Thus it has been difficult to reach definite conclusions. </p><p>Vermeer's Camera takes a wholly new approach to the issue, via the geometrical structure of Vermeer's pictures of domestic interiors. Through this route it is possible to reconstruct, with great precision, the architecture of the room in which Vermeer set as many as a dozen of his compositions, and to confirm that he depicts real pieces of furniture, real maps and real paintings - all of which survive today - at their actual known sizes. The central finding of the book is that the projected images, on the back wall of at least six of Vermeer's views of this room, are the exact same sizes as the canvases themselves. It is very difficult to explain this result, other than as powerful evidence of Vermeer tracing these images in a camera obscura. The fact that the arguments of the book are geometrical ones, about unarguable, measurable properties of the paintings themselves, gives them a special force. </p><p>The geometrical results cannot easily be accounted for by the idea that Vermeer worked, not optically, but mathematically. Indeed Vermeer's Camera demonstrates that, although it is plausible in itself that Vermeer might have used textbook perspective methods, there is no positive evidence for this proposition (not even the presence of tiny pinholes at the perspective 'vanishing points', as some authors including Wadum have argued). </p><p>Philip Steadman, January 2001</p></p><h2>Ecce Romani : a Latin Reading Program 2</h2><p><p>This hardcover edition contains Chapters 28 through 54 of the storyline, plus outstanding support for Word Study, Roman Life, Frontier Life, History, and Mythology.

Not anymore.</b> <br> In this richly detailed and eye-opening book, Rick Wartzman chronicles the erosion of the relationship between American companies and their workers. Through the stories of four major employers--General Motors, General Electric, Kodak, and Coca-Cola--he shows how big businesses once took responsibility for providing their workers and retirees with an array of social benefits. At the height of the post-World War II economy, these companies also believed that worker pay needed to be kept high in order to preserve morale and keep the economy humming. Productivity boomed. <br> But the corporate social contract didn't last. By tracing the ups and downs of these four corporate icons over seventy years, Wartzman illustrates just how much has been lost: job security and steadily rising pay, guaranteed pensions, robust health benefits, and much more. Charting the Golden Age of the '50s and '60s; the turbulent years of the '70s and '80s; and the growth of downsizing, outsourcing, and instability in the modern era, Wartzman's narrative is a biography of the American Dream gone sideways. <br> Deeply researched and compelling, <i>The End of Loyalty</i> will make you rethink how Americans can begin to resurrect the middle class.<br><b>Finalist for the <i>Los Angeles Times </i>book prize in current interest</b><b>A best business book of the year in economics, <i>Strategy+Business</i></b></p><p><b>Rick Wartzman</b> is director of the KH Moon Center for a Functioning Society at the Drucker Institute, a part of Claremont Graduate University.

He was also a Cubist painter and a World War I veteran. At the age of 23, he abandoned his artistic pursuits for voluntary service as an ambulance driver in France. His military career culminated in a comedy of errors leading to his arrest and imprisonment for treason, as he memorably recounts in <i>The Enormous Room</i>. <br>Cummings transforms a tale of unjust incarceration into a high-energy romp and a celebration of the indomitable human spirit that ranks with the best of its contemporaries, including the works of Hemingway and Dos Passos. This edition restores a significant amount of material deleted from the book's initial publication in 1922.</p><p><b>Edward Estlin Cummings </b>was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1894, the son of a Unitarian minister. Educated at Harvard, in 1917 he moved to Greenwich Village in New York City and began to write poetry and paint. In June of that year he went to France as a Red Cross volunteer with the ambulance corps and was soon arrested and imprisoned, though not charged with a crime, in a French concentration camp. That experience inspired his autobiographical novel, <b>The Enormous Room</b>, which was published in 1922. The next year <b>Tulips and Chimneys</b>, the first of his many volumes of poetry, appeared. It is for his typographically creative poetry that he is best known, but Cummings also painted and wrote expressionist verse drama and prose. Until the 1930s, he preferred the lowercase e.e. cummings. He lived in Paris for a few years after World War I, then returned to New York. He died in 1962 in North Conway, New Hampshire.<br>Samuel Hynes is Woodrow Wilson Professor of Literature Emeritus at Princeton University and the author of several major works of literary criticism, including <b>The Auden Generation</b>, <b>Edwardian Occasions</b>, and <b>The Edwardian Turn of Mind</b>.

"</p><h2>The Waves (Vintage Classics Woolf Series): Virginia Woolf</h2><p><i>The Waves</i> is an astonishingly beautiful and poetic novel. It begins with six children playing in a garden by the sea and follows their lives as they grow up and experience friendship, love and grief at the death of their beloved friend Percival. Regarded by many as her greatest work, <i>The Waves</i> is also seen as Virginia Woolf's response to the loss of her brother Thoby, who died when he was twenty-six.</p><p>"Clear, bright, burnished, at once marvellously accurate and subtly connotative. The pure, delicate sensibility found in this language and the moods that it expresses are a true kind of poetry" (<i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>"As a reader, as a writer, I constantly return, for the lyricism of it, the melancholy, the humanity" (Amy Sackville <i>Independent</i>)'Virginia Woolf wanted to write about the vast unknown uncertain continent that is the world and us in it' Jeanette Winterson, from her introduction to <i>The Waves</i></p><h2>Beloved: (Great Books Edition) (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century)</h2><p>Staring unflinchingly into the abyss of slavery, this novel transforms history into a story as powerful as Exodus and as intimate as a lullaby. Sethe, its protagonist, was born a slave and escaped to Ohio, but eighteen years later she is still not free. She has too many memories of Sweet Home, the beautiful farm where so many hideous things happened. And Sethe&#39;s new home is haunted by the ghost of her baby, who died nameless and whose tombstone is engraved with a single word: Beloved.</p><p>As with the ghost at its center, <i>Beloved</i> has taken many forms--from the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel to Oprah Winfrey's decade-in-the-making movie to this challenging audiobook read by Lynn Whitfield. Whitfield, who won an Emmy Award playing the title role in <i>The Josephine Baker Story</i>, has a tough assignment as she guides us back and forth in time with Sethe, an escaped slave who's still shackled by memories of her murdered child. But, as we shift between Sethe's brutal plantation days and her haunted life immediately after the Civil War, we learn one secret after another until, finally, past and present are masterfully reconciled. (Running time: three hours, two cassettes) <i>--Kimberly Heinrichs</i>Toni Morrison--author of Song of Solomon and Tar Baby--is a writer of remarkable powers: her novels, brilliantly acclaimed for their passion, their dazzling language and their lyric and emotional force, combine the unassailable truths of experience and emotion with the vision of legend and imagination. <br>It is the story--set in post-Civil War Ohio--of Sethe, an escaped slave who has risked death in order to wrench herself from a living death; who has lost a husband and buried a child; who has borne the unthinkable and not gone mad: a woman of "iron eyes and backbone to match." Sethe lives in a small house on the edge of town with her daughter, Denver, her mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, and a disturbing, mesmerizing intruder who calls herself Beloved. <br>Sethe works at "beating back the past," but it is alive in all of them. It keeps Denver fearful of straying from the house. It fuels the sadness that has settled into Baby Suggs' "desolated center where the self that was no self made its home." And to Sethe, the past makes itself heard and felt incessantly: in memories that both haunt and soothe her...in the arrival of Paul D ("There was something blessed in his manner. Women saw him and wanted to weep"), one of her fellow slaves on the farm where she had once been kept...in the vivid and painfully cathartic stories she and Paul D tell each other of their years in captivity, of their glimpses of freedom...and, most powerfully, in the apparition of Beloved, whose eyes are expressionless at their deepest point, whose doomed childhood belongs to the hideous logic of slavery and who, as daughter, sister and seductress, has now come from the "place over there" to claim retribution for what shelost and for what was taken from her. <br>Sethe's struggle to keep Beloved from gaining full possession of her present--and to throw off the long, dark legacy of her past--is at the center of this profoundly affecting and startling novel. But its intensity and resonance of feeling, and the boldness of its narrative, lift it beyond its particulars so that it speaks to our experience as an entire nation with a past of both abominable and ennobling circumstance. <br>In Beloved, Toni Morrison has given us a great American novel. <br>Toni Morrison was awarded the 1988 Pulitzer Prize in Literature for Beloved.</p><h2>The Mysterious Affair at Styles (Dover Mystery Classics)</h2><p>When an aging heiress is found fatally poisoned, the amazing Hercule Poirot, brilliant Belgian criminal investigator, is brought out of retirement to solve the case.<br>In this classic tale of murder, jealousy, and greed, Agatha Christie introduced the famed sleuth, who is immediately confronted by mysteries within a mystery: a door bolted from the inside of the victim&#x2019;s room; the disappearance of a coffee cup believed to have held the poison; the charred remains of a will, a strange fragment of fabric, and a curious rug stain found near the body.<br>All are puzzling pieces of evidence in a crime for which there is no shortage of suspects, not the least of which are the victim&#x2019;s philandering husband, an assortment of unhappy relatives, and an extremely outspoken hired companion.<br>A perennial favorite with mystery fans since it was first published in 1921, this entertaining and tautly constructed murder mystery easily placed its author among the most accomplished and entertaining writers in the genre.</p><p>Here is the famous first case that launched the legendary career of Hercule Poirot and his ingenious creator Agatha Christie, now the most popular mystery writer of all time, as well as the world's best-selling author (over two billion copies of her books are in print). With The Mysterious Affair at Styles, Agatha Christie's cerebral and eccentric Belgian detective steps out of retirement and into the limelight of a classic mystery.<p>Styles Court is a magnificent English manor house owned by a rich, strong-willed matron who, to the dismay of her stepson, has recently married a fortune hunter. The scene is set for death by violence. The murder of the mistress of Styles Court is so baffling, so cleverly-plotted, that it challenges even the skill of Hercule Poirot, notwithstanding the legions of tiny gray cells that take residence in his ever-so-fertile mind.</p>Who poisoned the wealthy Emily Inglethorpe, and how did the murderer penetrate and escape from her locked bedroom? Sus-pects abound in the quaint village of Styles St. Mary--from the heiress's fawning new husband to her two stepsons, her volatile housekeeper, and a pretty nurse who works in a hospital dispensary. Making his unforgettable debut, the brilliant Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is on the case. <br>"The key to the success of this style of detective novel," writes Elizabeth George in her Introduction, "lies in how the author deals with both the clues and the red herrings, and it has to be said that no one bettered Agatha Christie at this game."</p><h2>War and Peace (3 Volume Set)</h2><p><p>Three-Volume Boxed Set<br>Translated by Louise and Aylmer&nbsp;Maude<br><br><i>War and Peace</i> broadly focuses on Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812 and follows three of the most well-known characters in literature: Pierre Bezukhov, the illegitimate son of a count who is fighting for his inheritance and yearning for spiritual fulfillment; Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, who leaves his family behind to fight in the war against Napoleon; and Natasha Rostov, the beautiful young daughter of a nobleman who intrigues both men. <br><br>As Napoleon's army invades, Tolstoy brilliantly follows characters from diverse backgrounds&#x2014;peasants and nobility, civilians and soldiers&#x2014;as they struggle with the problems unique to their era, their history, and their culture. And as the novel progresses, these characters transcend their specificity, becoming some of the most moving&#x2014;and human&#x2014;figures in world literature. <br><br>(Book Jacket Status: Not Jacketed)</p></p><p>Among the great novels of the world, &#39;War and Peace&#39; has long held pride of place because it fulfills, in its seamless interweaving of the historical and the personal, and its genius in registering the entire scale of human life, all the promise latent in the art of fiction itself.Three-Volume Boxed Set</p><h2>Growth of the Soil (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>The epic novel of man and nature that won its author the Nobel Prize in Literature, in the first new English translation in more than ninety years</b> <br><br><b>A Penguin Classic</b><br><br> When it was first published in 1917,&nbsp;<i>Growth of the Soil</i>&nbsp;was immediately recognized as a masterpiece.

The facts of his life, known from surviving documents, are sparse. He was one of eight children born to John Shakespeare, a merchant of some standing in his community. William probably went to the King&#x2019;s New School in Stratford, but he had no university education. In November 1582, at the age of eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway, eight years his senior, who was pregnant with their first child, Susanna. She was born on May 26, 1583. Twins, a boy, Hamnet ( who would die at age eleven), and a girl, Judith, were born in 1585. By 1592 Shakespeare had gone to London working as an actor and already known as a playwright. A rival dramatist, Robert Greene, referred to him as &#x201c;an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers.&#x201d; Shakespeare became a principal shareholder and playwright of the successful acting troupe, the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men (later under James I, called the King&#x2019;s Men). In 1599 the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men built and occupied the Globe Theater in Southwark near the Thames River. Here many of Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays were performed by the most famous actors of his time, including Richard Burbage, Will Kempe, and Robert Armin. In addition to his 37 plays, Shakespeare had a hand in others, including <i>Sir Thomas More</i> and <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, and he wrote poems, including <i>Venus and Adonis</i> and <i>The Rape of Lucrece</i>. His 154 sonnets were published, probably without his authorization, in 1609. In 1611 or 1612 he gave up his lodgings in London and devoted more and more time to retirement in Stratford, though he continued writing such plays as <b>The Tempest</b> and <b>Henry VII</b> until about 1613. He died on April 23 1616, and was buried in Holy Trinity Church, Stratford. No collected edition of his plays was published during his life-time, but in 1623 two members of his acting company, John Heminges and Henry Condell, put together the great collection now called the First Folio.</p><h2>Grammar in Context 1, Fourth Edition (Student Book)</h2><p>National Geographic Learning&#39;s best selling grammar series now has more of what works for students and teachers!

At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate; this far from civilization the boys can do anything they want. Anything. They attempt to forge their own society, failing, however, in the face of terror, sin and evil. And as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of being rescued. Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, <i>Lord of the Flies </i>is perhaps our most memorable tale about &#x201c;the end of innocence, the darkness of man&#x2019;s heart.&#x201d;</p><p>William Golding's classic tale about a group of English schoolboys who are plane-wrecked on a deserted island is just as chilling and relevant today as when it was first published in 1954. At first, the stranded boys cooperate, attempting to gather food, make shelters, and maintain signal fires. Overseeing their efforts are Ralph, "the boy with fair hair," and Piggy, Ralph's chubby, wisdom-dispensing sidekick whose thick spectacles come in handy for lighting fires. Although Ralph tries to impose order and delegate responsibility, there are many in their number who would rather swim, play, or hunt the island's wild pig population. Soon Ralph's rules are being ignored or challenged outright. His fiercest antagonist is Jack, the redheaded leader of the pig hunters, who manages to lure away many of the boys to join his band of painted savages. The situation deteriorates as the trappings of civilization continue to fall away, until Ralph discovers that instead of being hunters, he and Piggy have become the hunted: "He forgot his words, his hunger and thirst, and became fear; hopeless fear on flying feet." Golding's gripping novel explores the boundary between human reason and animal instinct, all on the brutal playing field of adolescent competition. <i>--Jennifer Hubert</i>Few works in literature have received as much popular and critical attention as Nobel Laureate William Golding's Lord of the Flies. Since its publication in 1954, it has amassed a cult following, and has significantly contributed to our dystopian vision of the post-war era. When responding to the novel's dazzling power of intellectual insight, scholars and critics often invoke the works of Shakespeare, Freud, Rousseau, Sartre, Orwell, and Conrad.<p>Golding's aim to "trace the defect of society back to the defect of human nature" is elegantly pursued in this gripping adventure tale about a group of British schoolboys marooned on a tropical island. Alone in a world of uncharted possibilities, devoid of adult supervision or rules, the boys attempt to forge their own society, failing, however, in the face of terror, sin, and evil. Part parable, allegory, myth, parody, political treatise, and apocalyptic vision, Lord of the Flies is perhaps the most memorable tale about "the end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart".</p></p><h2>The Last Letter from Juliet: An absolutely unforgettable and heartbreaking WWII historical romance novel</h2><p><p><strong><em>Me Before You</em> meets <em>The English Patient</em> in this stunning romantic novel from award-winning author Melanie Hudson.</strong></p><p><em>This is a note to yourself, Juliet.</em></p><p><em>At the time of writing you are ninety-two years old and worried that bits and bobs of your story have begun to go astray.

J. Leatherbarrow; Translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa VolokhonskyFyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky was born in Moscow in 1821, the second of a physician&#39;s seven children. His mother died in 1837 and his father was murdered a little over two years later. When he left his private boarding school in Moscow he studied from 1838 to 1843 at the Military Engineering College in St Petersburg, graduating with officer&#39;s rank. His first story to be published, &#39;Poor Folk&#39; (1846), was a great success. In 1849 he was arrested and sentenced to death for participating in the &#39;Petrashevsky circle&#39;; he was reprieved at the last moment but sentenced to penal servitude, and until 1854 he lived in a convict prison at Omsk, Siberia. In the decade following his return from exile he wrote The Village of Stepanchikovo (1859) and The House of the Dead (1860). Whereas the latter draws heavily on his experiences in prison, the former inhabits a completely different world, shot through with comedy and satire. In 1861 he began the review Vremya (Time) with his brother; in 1862 and 1863 he went abroad, where he strengthened his anti-European outlook, met Mlle Suslova, who was the model for many of his heroines, and gave way to his passion for gambling. In the following years he fell deeply in debt, but in 1867 he married Anna Grigoryevna Snitkina (his second wife), who helped to rescue him from his financial morass. They lived abroad for four years, then in 1873 he was invited to edit Grazhdanin (The Citizen), to which he contributed his Diary of a Writer. From 1876 the latter was issued separately and had a large circulation. In 1880 he delivered his famous address at the unveiling of Pushkin&#39;s memorial in Moscow; he died six months later in 1881. Most of his important works were written after 1864: Notes from Underground (1864), Crime and Punishment (1865-6), The Gambler (1866), The Idiot (1869), The Devils (1871) and The Brothers Karamazov (1880).</p><h2>The Art of Intrusion: The Real Stories Behind the Exploits of Hackers, Intruders and Deceivers</h2><p><b>Hacker extraordinaire Kevin Mitnick delivers the explosive encore to his bestselling <i>The Art of Deception</i></b><br> Kevin Mitnick, the world's most celebrated hacker, now devotes his life to helping businesses and governments combat data thieves, cybervandals, and other malicious computer intruders.

In the wake of discoveries through the telescope and Copernican theory, the notion of an ordered cosmos of "fixed stars" gave way to that of a universe infinite in both time and space&#x2015;with significant and far-reaching consequences for human thought.

Wellington was much more: a man of vision beyond purely military matters, a politically astute thinker, and a canny diplomat as well as lover, husband, and friend. Rory Muir&#x2019;s masterful new biography, the first of a two-volume set, is the fruit of a lifetime&#x2019;s research and discovery into Wellington and his times. The author brings Wellington into much sharper focus than ever before, addressing his masterstrokes and mistakes in equal measure.&nbsp;Muir looks at all aspects of Wellington&#x2019;s career, from his unpromising youth through his remarkable successes in India and his role as junior minister in charge of Ireland, to his controversial military campaigns. With dramatic descriptions of major battles and how they might have turned out differently, the author underscores the magnitude of Wellington&#x2019;s achievements. The biography is the first to address the major significance of Wellington&#x2019;s political connections and shrewdness, and to set his career within the wider history of British politics and the war against Napoleon. The volume also revises Wellington&#x2019;s reputation for being cold and aloof, showing instead a man of far more complex and interesting character.</p><p><b>Rory Muir</b> is visiting research fellow, University of Adelaide. His previously published books include a highly praised study of Wellington&#x2019;s great triumph at Salamanca and the edited letters of Alexander Gordon, Wellington&#x2019;s confidential aide-de-camp.

He details legitimate questions, some as old as Darwin's theory, some as new as molecular biology, but he also distorts or misrepresents other "problems." For example, he falls into the classic typological trap: organisms with the same name are all the same. He has Euparkeria as the closest possible ancestor of Archaeopteryx, thus displaying either ignorance or disregard for discoveries over the past two decades. He misunderstands or willfully misrepresents the nature of a cladogram as opposed to a phylogeny. Much of the book reads like creationist prattle, but there are also some interesting points.

The fourth section, dealing with the experiential learning of hypnosis, illustrates one of the senior author&#39;s favorite occupations in recent years: the training of professionals in the use of clinical hypnosis by allowing them to experience the process themselves.</p><p></p><h2>Metamorphoses (Penguin Clothbound Classics)</h2><p><b>Ovid&#x2019;s deliciously clever and exuberant epic, now in a gorgeous new clothbound edition</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Ovid&#x2019;s sensuous and witty poetry brings together a dazzling array of mythological tales, ingeniously linked by the idea of transformation&#x2014;often as a result of love or lust&#x2014;where men and women find themselves magically changed into new and sometimes extraordinary beings. Beginning with the creation of the world and ending with the deification of Augustus, Ovid interweaves many of the best-known myths and legends of Ancient Greece and Rome, including Daedalus and Icarus, Pyramus and Thisbe, Pygmalion, Perseus and Andromeda, and the fall of Troy. Erudite but lighthearted, dramatic yet playful, the <i>Metamorphoses</i> has influenced writers and artists throughout the centuries from Shakespeare and Titian to Picasso and Ted Hughes.<br> &nbsp;<br> This edition includes David Raeburn&#x2019;s modern verse translation, an introduction by Denis Feeney, and other features to help readers fully appreciate Ovid&#x2019;s epic.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Coming from a wealthy Roman family and seemingly destined for a career in politics, he held minor official posts before leaving public service to write, becoming the most distinguished poet of his time. His works, all published by Penguin Classics, include&nbsp;<i>Amores</i>, a collection of short love poems;&nbsp;<i>Heroides</i>, verse-letters written by mythological heroines to their lovers;&nbsp;<i>Ars Amatoria</i>, a satirical handbook on love; and&nbsp;<i>Metamorphoses</i>, his epic work that has inspired countless writers and artists through the ages.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>David Raeburn</b>&nbsp;(translator) is a lecturer in Classics at Oxford, and has also translated Sophocles&#x2019;&nbsp;<i>Electra and Other Plays</i>&nbsp;for Penguin Classics.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Denis Feeney</b> (introducer) is a professor of Classics at Princeton.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Coralie Bickford-Smith</b>&nbsp;(cover illustrator) is an award-winning designer at Penguin Books (U.K.), where she has created several highly acclaimed series designs. She studied typography at Reading University and lives in London.Metamorphoses -- The title of Ovid's most famous work, <i>Metamorphoses</i>, means "changes of shapes." He tells the reader at the very beginning, "My purpose is to tell of bodies which have been transformed into shapes of different kinds." Using a new translation of the work by Ian Johnston, Naxos AudioBooks has issued a 14-CD complete reading that is quite frankly stunning. The reader is British actor David Horovitch, who is best known as the sour Inspector Slack in the older Miss Marple series with Joan Hickson. It must be pointed out that Ovid was in deep trouble with Augustus, because many of Ovid's books displeased his Emperor who declared a family values campaign in Rome. So Ovid, knowing that Roman emperors believed they would be turned into stars (Julius Caesar) or gods (Caligula declared himself divine while still alive), patterned his newest book in such a way that man-into-god transformations seemed perfectly natural. To avoid monotony, Ovid is careful to vary the tone and length of one story after another. Characters in one story actually tell the story of another metamorphosis just before experiencing their own. He also treats his tales very dramatically, inventing dialogue so the myth reads like a drama. I was particularly impressed with the speech the God of the Sun, Phoebus, gives to his son Phaethon. Having promised him anything he wanted, Phoebus immediately regretted his unbreakable promise when Phaethon wanted to drive the Golden Chariot for a day. Ovid tells one rattling good yarn after another. While following without a written text, the listener might lose his way as to what character is now playing the lead, so to speak; but Horovitch's acting skills keep in synch with Ovid's moods and pacing, and hearing this Naxos set is quite a riveting experience. The total playing time is 17:32 hours. The tracking list must be downloaded from a website given on the back of the jewel case.

When she was 11 years old, her parents both had their identities stolen. Their credit ratings were ruined, and they were constantly fighting over money. This was before the age of the Internet, when identity theft became more commonplace, so authorities and banks were clueless and reluctant to help Axton's parents.<br>Axton's family changed all of their personal information and moved to different addresses, but the identity thief followed them wherever they went. Convinced that the thief had to be someone they knew, Axton and her parents completely cut off the outside world, isolating themselves from friends and family. Axton learned not to let anyone into the house without explicit permission, and once went as far as chasing a plumber off their property with a knife. <br><br>As a result, Axton spent her formative years crippled by anxiety, quarantined behind the closed curtains in her childhood home. She began starving herself at a young age in an effort to blend in--her appearance could be nothing short of perfect or she would be scolded by her mother, who had become paranoid and consumed by how others perceived the family.<br>Years later, her parents' marriage still shaken from the theft, Axton discovered that she, too, had fallen prey to the identity thief, but by the time she realized, she was already thousands of dollars in debt and her credit was ruined. <br><i>The Less People Know About Us</i> is Axton's attempt to untangle an intricate web of lies, and to understand why and how a loved one could have inflicted such pain. Axton will present a candid, shocking, and redemptive story and reveal her courageous effort to grapple with someone close that broke the unwritten rules of love, protection, and family.</p><p><b>Axton Betz-Hamilton </b>is an expert in identity theft, having personal experience that she's now turned into a career. After discovering her own mother had stolen hers and her father's identities for years, Axton made understanding the nuances of identity theft her life's work. She frequently speaks on the topic at a wide range of conferences and has won multiple awards for her research, teaching, and service.<br>Axton has a Master's degree in Consumer Sciences and Retailing and a PhD in Human Development and Family Studies, focusing on child identity theft and elder financial exploitation perpetrated by family members. She teaches at South Dakota State University."The tension of a thriller...[and] jaw dropping revelations. Astonishing and disturbing, this emotionally resonant book is perfect for true crime fans."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)<br></i></b><br><br>"This memoir has all the suspense and twists of a thriller; even as readers begin to suspect the truth, it still shocks...highly recommended."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Booklist</i></i></b><br><br>"'Identity theft' sounds like something that happens far, far away and only to other people...certainly not within a seemingly picture-perfect family in the rural U.S. In a gut-wrenching portrayal of victimization starting at age 11, Axton Betz-Hamilton shows that's simply not true. The stunning revelations will keep you looking over your shoulder for a long time and even more troubling...at the ones you think you know the best!"&#x2015;<b><i>Nancy Grace, legal commentator, broadcast journalist, and <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>The Eleventh Victim</i><br></i></b><br><br>"Axton Betz-Hamilton's story is remarkable. One of the primary challenges for those of us advocating for more rights and resources for identity theft victims is their reluctance to share their experience. Betz-Hamilton writes with candor and grace about both her relationship with her mother/perpetrator, and the long term effect victimization has had on her life."&#x2015;<b><i>Eva Casey Velasquez, president/CEO of Identity Theft Resource Center</i></b><br><br>"A brave, rueful memoir of fear and heartbreak in rural America. Axton Betz-Hamilton mines the most essential of life's questions: can we ever really know the people we love? <i>The Less People Know About Us </i>is an unflinching portrait of grit and determination in the wake of a fractured childhood and complicated grief.<b>"</b>&#x2015;<b><i>Carolyn Murnick, author of <i>The Hot One</i></i></b></p><h2>Fundamentals of English Grammar Workbook, 4th Edition</h2><p>ISBN 9780138022129 is student Workbook only This is workbook to use with Fundamentals of English Grammar.

From this point onward we are in little doubt as to <i>Amsterdam</i>'s outcome--it's only a matter of who will kill whom. In the meantime, compromising photographs of Molly's most distinguished lover, foreign secretary Julian Garmony, have found their way into the hands of the press, and as rumors circulate he teeters on the edge of disgrace. However, this is McEwan, so it is no surprise to find that the rather unsavory Garmony comes out on top. Ian McEwan is master of the writer's craft, and while this is the sort of novel that wins prizes, his characters remain curiously soulless amidst the twists and turns of plot. <i>--Lisa Jardine</i>On a chilly February day, two old friends meet in the throng outside a London crematorium to pay their last respects to Molly Lane. Both Clive Linley and Vernon Halliday had been Molly's lovers in the days before they reached their current eminence: Clive is Britain's most successful modern composer, and Vernon is editor of the newspaper "The Judge. Gorgeous, feisty Molly had other lovers, too, notably Julian Garmony, Foreign Secretary, a notorious right-winger tipped to be the next prime minister. <br>In the days that follow Molly's funeral, Clive and Vernon will make a pact with consequences that neither could have foreseen. Each will make a disastrous moral decision, their friendship will be tested to its limits, and Julian Garmony will be fighting for his political life.

Whether he is quashing the Catiline conspiracy, defending the poet Archais or railing against Mark Anthony in the Philippics - The magnificent speeches in defense of liberty that cost him his life - cicero vividly evokes for us the cut and thrust of the Roman assembly, Senate and court rooms. This excellent modern translation also enables readers to understand why Cicero was for centuries a major influence on prose writers and political thinkers of ever kind.<br><br> For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

He was taken to Rome for his education with the idea of a public career and by the year 70 he had established himself as the leading barrister in Rome. In the meantime his political career was well under way and he was elected praetor for the year 66. One of the most permanent features of his political life was his attachment to Pompeii. As a politician, his greatest failing was his consistent refusal to compromise; as a statesman his ideals were more honorable and unselfish than those of his contemporaries. Cicero was the greatest of the roman orators, posessing a wide range of technique and an excpetional command of the Latin tongue. He followed the common practice of publishing his speeches, but he also produced a large number of works on the theory and practice of rhetoric, on religion, and on moral and political philosophy. He played a leading part in the development of the Latin hexameter. Perhaps the most interesting of all his works is the collection fo 900 remarkably informative letters, published posthumously. These not only contain a first-hand account of social and political life in the upper classes at Rome, but also reflect the changing personal feelings of an emotional and sensitive man.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Latin</p><h2>Simple passion</h2><p>A novel of lust and infatuation tells the story of a love affair and captures the dark side of the human condition when it is influenced by simple, physical passion.</p><p>of lyrical precision and diamond-hard clarity....A remembrance of desire past."<br>THE NEW YORKER<br>Memoirist Annie Ernaux has written eloquently about loss. Now she writes of another kind of loss, the loss of herself in a love and then the loss of the love itself.

But what about the final spaces that architects themselves will occupy? Are architects' gravesites more monumental&#x2015;more architectural&#x2015;than others? This unique book provides an illustrated guide to more than 200 gravesites of famous architects, almost all of them in the United States. Led by our intrepid author, Henry Kuehn, we find that most graves of architects are not monumental but rather modest, that many architects did not design their final resting places, and that a surprising number had their ashes scattered.</p><p><i>Architects' Gravesites</i> offers an alphabetical listing, from Alvar Aalto and Dankmar Adler (Louis Sullivan's partner) to Frank Lloyd Wright and Minoru Yamasaki (designer of the Word Trade Center's twin towers). Each entry includes a brief note on the architect's career and a color photograph of the site. For example, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe is buried in Chicago under a simple granite slab designed by his architect grandson; Louise Bethune, the first American woman to become a professional architect, is buried under a headstone inscribed only with her husband's name (a plaque honoring her achievements was installed later); Philip Johnson's ashes were spread in his rose garden, with no marker, across the street from his famous Glass House; and the grave of Pierre L'Enfant in Arlington National Cemetery offers a breathtaking view of Washington, D.C., the city he designed. </p><p><i>Architects' Gravesites</i> is an architectural guide like no other, revealing as much about mortality as about monumentality.</p></p><p>Henry H.

Out of this complex narrative emerges a profound examination of the individual&#x2019;s place in the historical process, one that makes it clear why Thomas Mann praised Tolstoy for his Homeric powers and placed&nbsp;<i>War and Peace</i>&nbsp;in the same category as the&nbsp;<i>Iliad:</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;To read him . . . is to find one&#x2019; s way home . . . to everything within us that is fundamental and sane.&#x201d;</p></p><p>&#39;There remains the greatest of all novelists-for what else can we call the author of War And Peace?

He notices the blue or red of a child&#39;s frock; the way a horse shifts its tail; the sound of a cough; the action of a man trying to put his hands into pockets that have been sewn up.

A town that would rather have been known for its Little League World Series champions ended up making history for an entirely different reason: a notorious cluster of childhood cancers scientifically linked to local air and water pollution. For years, large chemical companies had been using Toms River as their private dumping ground, burying tens of thousands of leaky drums in open pits and discharging billions of gallons of acid-laced wastewater into the town&#x2019;s namesake river.<br><br>In an astonishing feat of investigative reporting, prize-winning journalist Dan Fagin recounts the sixty-year saga of rampant pollution and inadequate oversight that made Toms River a cautionary example for fast-growing industrial towns from South Jersey to South China. He tells the stories of the pioneering scientists and physicians who first identified pollutants as a cause of cancer, and brings to life the everyday heroes in Toms River who struggled for justice: a young boy whose cherubic smile belied the fast-growing tumors that had decimated his body from birth; a nurse who fought to bring the alarming incidence of childhood cancers to the attention of authorities who didn&#x2019;t want to listen; and a mother whose love for her stricken child transformed her into a tenacious advocate for change.<br><br>A gripping human drama rooted in a centuries-old scientific quest, <i>Toms River</i> is a tale of dumpers at midnight and deceptions in broad daylight, of corporate avarice and government neglect, and of a few brave individuals who refused to keep silent until the truth was exposed.<br><br><b><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR AND&nbsp;<i>KIRKUS REVIEWS</i></b><br><br></b>&#x201c;A thrilling journey full of twists and turns, <i>Toms River</i> is essential reading for our times.

In this book, Stephen Eric Bronner provides sketches of leading representatives of the critical tradition (such as George Luk�cs and Ernst Bloch, Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin, Herbert Marcuse and Jurgen Habermas) as well as many of its seminal texts and empirical investigations. This <em>Very Short Introduction</em> sheds light on the cluster of concepts and themes that set critical theory apart from its more traditional philosophical competitors. Bronner explains and discusses concepts such as method and agency, alienation and reification, the culture industry and repressive tolerance, non-identity and utopia. He argues for the introduction of new categories and perspectives for illuminating the obstacles to progressive change and focusing upon hidden transformative possibilities. Only a critique of critical theory can render it salient for a new age.

What is the difference between nations using alcohol to lure natives into questionable transactions, and drug dealers selling their products in dark corners (or broad daylight)? <b>David Courtwright</b>&#x2019;s illuminating history of drugs in the modern world will shock and surprise readers who still believe that only criminals use&#x2015;and want&#x2015;drugs.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Lee Milazzo</b><b>, </b><b><i>Dallas Morning News</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[<b>Courtwright</b>&#x2019;s] clearly written, thoughtful book...is unique in its broad scope... There is a lot to keep straight in this readable account. Though not a comprehensive history of drugs, it is good at identifying the trends and patterns from about the sixteenth century that have brought about Courtwright&#x2019;s &#x2018;psychoactive revolution.&#x2019; This is the book to go to when planning an assault on <i>Jeopardy!</i>&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Barbara Liss</b><b>, </b><b><i>Houston Chronicle</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[With] entertaining details...[<b>Courtwright</b>&#x2019;s] lively writing spices up a serious take on a grave subject. While Courtwright sees licit substances like tea and illegal heavy-hitters like cocaine as two ends of the same spectrum, he&#x2019;s by no means trying to minimize the dangers of drugs. Rather, he wants to lay out the history clearly&#x2015;perhaps partly hoping that if policy setters understand how drug use spread so widely and deeply, they&#x2019;ll be better equipped to fight it.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Polly Shulman</b><b>, </b><b><i>Newsday</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Alcohol joins caffeine and tobacco to round out what <b>Courtwright</b> calls the &#x2018;big three&#x2019; of currently legal psychoactive drugs. As he sees it, modern civilization is practically unthinkable without this trio. But why have they fared so well while equally intoxicating substances&#x2015;like, say, marijuana&#x2015;are banned and stigmatized, and others&#x2015;like kava, khat and betel&#x2015;are popular only in distinct geographic areas? And why is tobacco currently falling in popularity, while alcohol and caffeine are holding their grip on us? These questions are only partly answered in Courtwright&#x2019;s otherwise excellent book, but that&#x2019;s not really his fault. Drugs are as deceptive and multifaceted as the human beings whose metabolisms they mess with; a history of drugs may be possible, but an analysis of their role in culture is bound to be incomplete and provisional. There are simply too many ways to tell the story...

Courtwright, a historian who has written earlier admired books examining illegal drugs and the nature of violence in America, describes the rise of the global drug trade, discusses why some drugs are more popular than others, and then considers the intersection of drugs and political and economic power... What then caused the commercial and political leaders of the western world, who were profiting so wonderfully from the psychoactive revolution to reconsider their avid promotion of these products? In a phrase: the industrial revolution. As Courtwright so succinctly puts it, &#x2018;A drunken field hand was one thing, a drunken railroad brakeman quite another.&#x2019;&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jill Jonnes</b><b>, </b><b><i>Baltimore Sun</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[This book] couldn&#x2019;t be more timely arriving amid challenges to national drug policy...

A tremendous bestseller when it was first published in 1925,&nbsp;<i>An American Tragedy</i>&nbsp;takes as point of departure a notorious murder case of 1906&#x2014;one among many that Dreiser studied in preparation. He immersed himself in the social background of the crime to produce a book that is a remarkable work of reportage, a monumental study of character, and a stunning jeremiad against the delusions and inequities of American society.<br><br>Few novels have undertaken to track so relentlessly the process by which an ordinary young man becomes capable of committing a ruthless murder and the further process by which social and political forces come into play after his arrest. In Clyde Griffiths, the impoverished, restless offspring of a family of street preachers, Dreiser created an unforgettable portrait of a man whose social insecurities and naive dreams of self-betterment conspire to pull him toward act of unforgivable violence. The murder that he commits on a quiet lake in the Adirondacks is an extended scene of overwhelming impact, and it is followed by equally gripping episodes of his arrest and trial. Throughout, Dreiser elevates the most mundane aspects of what he observes into emotionally charged, often harrowing symbols.<br><br>Around Clyde, Dreiser builds an extraordinarily detailed portrait of early twentieth-century America, its religious and sexual hypocrisies, its economic pressures, its political corruption and journalistic exploitation. The sheer prophetic amplitude of his bitter truth-telling, in idiosyncratic prose of uncanny expressiveness, continues to mark Dreiser as a crucially important American writer.&nbsp;<i>An American Tragedy</i>, the great achievement of his later years, is a work of mythic force, at once brutal and heartbreaking.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.</p><p>Theodore Dreiser set out to create an epic character and, in the form of Clyde Griffiths in <i>An American Tragedy</i>, he succeeded. Griffiths is just a Midwest kid, the son of a preacher in Kansas City, who tastes a little sophistication and then hits the road seeking pleasure and success. He has his moments, conducting more than one romantic affair, until that ill-advised pursuit ensnares him. Then he reads about an "accident" of a young woman and ponders a dastardly deed ... Dreiser spins these scenes with the eye of a master in control of his form. <i>An American Tragedy</i> stands as an American masterpiece.<b>Theodore Dreiser</b> was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, on August 27, 1871. After a poor and difficult childhood, Dreiser broke into newspaper work in Chicago in 1892. A successful career as a magazine writer in New York during the late 1890s was followed by his first novel, <b>Sister Carrie</b> (1900). When this work made little impact, Dreiser published no fiction until <b>Jennie Gerhardt</b> in 1911. There then followed a decade and a half of major work in a number of literary forms, which was capped in 1925 by <b>An American Tragedy</b>, a novel that brought him universal acclaim. Dreiser was increasingly preoccupied by philosophical and political issues during the last two decades of his life. He died in Los Angeles on December 28, 1945.</p><h2>Canterbury Tales (Everyman&#39;s Library)</h2><p><p>The precise, unerring, delicately emphatic characterizations for which <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> is so famous are no more extraordinary than Chaucer&#x2019;s utter mastery of English rhythms and his effortless versification. Ranging from animal fables to miniature epics of courtly love and savagely hilarious comedies of sexual comeuppance, these stories told by pilgrims on the way to the shrine of Thomas � Becket in Canterbury reveal a teeming, vital fourteenth-century English society on the verge of its Renaissance.<br><br></p>These tales bring together a band of pilgrims who represented most of the occupations and social groups of the time. The diversity of the narrators in turn made possible a varied collection of tales including chivalric romance, spiritual allegory, courtly lay, beast fable and literary satire.</p><p>On a spring day in April--sometime in the waning years of the 14th century--29 travelers set out for Canterbury on a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Thomas Beckett. Among them is a knight, a monk, a prioress, a plowman, a miller, a merchant, a clerk, and an oft-widowed wife from Bath. Travel is arduous and wearing; to maintain their spirits, this band of pilgrims entertains each other with a series of tall tales that span the spectrum of literary genres. Five hundred years later, people are still reading Geoffrey Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. If you haven't yet made the acquaintance of the Franklin, the Pardoner, or the Squire because you never learned Middle English, take heart: this edition of the <i>Tales</i> has been translated into modern idiom. <p> From the heroic romance of "The Knight's Tale" to the low farce embodied in the stories of the Miller, the Reeve, and the Merchant, Chaucer treated such universal subjects as love, sex, and death in poetry that is simultaneously witty, insightful, and poignant. <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> is a grand tour of 14th-century English mores and morals--one that modern-day readers will enjoy.</p>This textbook series provides concise and lucid introductions to major works of literature, from classical antiquity to the twentieth century.

Lucy Maud Montgomery wrote in her journal when she was just fourteen.&nbsp;&nbsp;This journal entry, made in 1889, is significant to readers today who know that when she grew up she not only owned and read many books, but also became the world-famous author L. M. Montgomery.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maud, as she liked to be called by family and friends, wrote twenty-four books between 1908 and 1939.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her first was <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>, and her other works include seven more <i>Anne</i> books, the Avonlea stories, the <i>Emily</i> trilogy, two novels for adults, an autobiography, and the novel <i>The Story Girl.</i><br><br>Lucy Maud Montgomery was always writing and reading and was quite a story girl herself, creating more than five hundred short stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;She also wrote many poems.&nbsp;&nbsp;One edition of her poetry was published during her lifetime and today all her poems have been collected in a single volume.The lush, evocative chronicles of THE GOLDEN ROAD have that quaint verboseness of post-Victorian times.

Conlin sustains the idyllic, gossipy quality of Montgomery&#39;s story, set on a farm in Carlisle, P.E.I. She projects the sentimental aura of the turn of the century. In today&#39;s times, a more &#34;acted&#34; rendering might possibly have provided a wider appeal. Conlin elects to err on the side of caution, thus relinquishing some liveliness. S.E.S.

P. LOVECRAFT is one of the seminal horror authors of the twentieth century. He wrote more than one hundred stories, and achieved popular acclaim in such publications as Astounding Stories and Weird Tales. Though he died in 1937, the small press publisher Arkham House was established in 1939 to preserve Lovecraft&#x2019;s works for future generationsChapter 1 <br><br> I am forced into speech because men of science have refused to follow my advice without knowing why. It is altogether against my will that I tell my reasons for opposing this contemplated invasion of the antarctic with its vast fossil-hunt and its wholesale boring and melting of the ancient ice-cap and I am the more reluctant because my warning may be in vain. Doubt of the real facts, as I must reveal them, is inevitable; yet if I suppressed what will seem extravagant and incredible there would be nothing left. The hitherto withheld photographs, both ordinary and a&#x2018;rial, will count in my favour; for they are damnably vivid and graphic. Still, they will be doubted because of the great lengths to which clever fakery can be carried. The ink drawings, of course, will be jeered at as obvious impostures; notwithstanding a strangeness of technique which art experts ought to remark and puzzle over. In the end I must rely on the judgment and standing of the few scientific leaders who have, on the one hand, sufficient independence of thought to weigh my data on its own hideously convincing merits or in the light of certain primordial and highly baffling myth-cycles; and on the other hand, sufficient influence to deter the exploring world in general from any rash and overambitious programme in the region of those mountains of madness. It is an unfortunate fact that relatively obscure men like myself and my associates, connected only with a small university, have little chance of making an impression where matters of a wildly bizarre or highly controversial nature are concerned. It is further against us that we are not, in the strictest sense, specialists in the fields which came primarily to be concerned. <br><br>As a geologist my object in leading the Miskatonic University Expedition was wholly that of securing deep-level specimens of rock and soil from various parts of the antarctic continent, aided by the remarkable drill devised by Prof. Frank H. Pabodie of our engineering department. I had no wish to be a pioneer in any other field than this; but I did hope that the use of this new mechanical appliance at different points along previously explored paths would bring to light materials of a sort hitherto unreached by the ordinary methods of collection. Pabodie's drilling apparatus, as the public already knows from our reports, was unique and radical in its lightness, portability, and capacity to combine the ordinary artesian drill principle with the principle of the small circular rock drill in such a way as to cope quickly with strata of varying hardness. Steel head, jointed rods, gasoline motor, collapsible wooden derrick, dynamiting paraphernalia, cording, rubbish-removal auger, and sectional piping for bores five inches wide and up to 1,000 feet deep all formed, with needed accessories, no greater load than three seven-dog sledges could carry; this being made possible by the clever aluminum alloy of which most of the metal objects were fashioned. Four large Dornier a&#x2018;roplanes, designed especially for the tremendous altitude flying necessary on the antarctic plateau and with added fuel-warming and quick-starting devices worked out by Pabodie, could transport our entire expedition from a base at the edge of the great ice barrier to various suitable inland points, and from these points a sufficient quota of dogs would serve us. We planned to cover as great an area as one antarctic seasonor longer, if absolutely necessary would permit, operating mostly in the mountain-ranges and on the plateau south of Ross Sea; regions explored in varying degree by Shackleton, Amundsen, Scott, and Byrd.<br><br> With frequent changes of camp, made by a&#x2018;roplane and involving distances great enough to be of geological significance, we expected to unearth a quite unprecedented amount of material; especially in the pre-Cambrian strata of which so narrow a range of antarctic specimens had previously been secured. We wished also to obtain as great as possible a variety of the upper fossiliferous rocks, since the primal life-history of this bleak realm of ice and death is of the highest importance to our knowledge of the earth�s past. That the antarctic continent was once temperate and even tropical, with a teeming vegetable and animal life of which the lichens, marine fauna, arachnida, and penguins of the northern edge are the only survivals, is a matter of common information; and we hoped to expand that information in variety, accuracy, and detail. When a simple boring revealed fossiliferous signs, we would enlarge the aperture by blasting in order to get specimens of suitable size and condition. Our borings, of varying depth according to the promise held out by the upper soil or rock, were to be confined to exposed or nearly exposed land surfaces these inevitably being slopes and ridges because of the mile or two-mile thickness of solid ice overlying the lower levels. We could not afford to waste drilling depth on any considerable amount of mere glaciation, though Pabodie had worked out a plan for sinking copper electrodes in thick clusters of borings and melting off limited areas of ice with current from a gasoline-driven dynamo. It is this plan which we could not put into effect except experimentally on an expedition such as ours�that the coming Starkweather-Moore Expedition proposes to follow despite the warnings I have issued since our return from the antarctic. <br><br>The public knows of the Miskatonic Expedition through our frequent wireless reports to the Arkham Advertiser and Associated Press, and through the later articles of Pabodie and myself. We consisted of four men from the University�Pabodie, Lake of the biology department, Atwood of the physics department (also a meteorologist), and I representing geology and having nominal command�besides sixteen assistants; seven graduate students from Miskatonic and nine skilled mechanics. Of these sixteen, twelve were qualified a&#x2018;roplane pilots, all but two of whom were competent wireless operators. Eight of them understood navigation with compass and sextant, as did Pabodie, Atwood, and I. In addition, of course, our two ships wooden ex-whalers, reinforced for ice conditions and having auxiliary steam�were fully manned. The Nathaniel Derby Pickman Foundation, aided by a few special contributions, financed the expedition; hence our preparations were extremely thorough despite the absence of great publicity. The dogs, sledges, machines, camp materials, and unassembled parts of our five planes were delivered in Boston, and there our ships were loaded. We were marvellously well-equipped for our specific purposes, and in all matters pertaining to supplies, regimen, transportation, and camp construction we profited by the excellent example of our many recent and exceptionally brilliant predecessors. It was the unusual number and fame of these predecessors which made our own expedition�ample though it was�so little noticed by the world at large. As the newspapers told, we sailed from Boston Harbour on September 2, 1930; taking a leisurely course down the coast and through the Panama Canal, and stopping at Samoa and Hobart, Tasmania, at which latter place we took on final supplies. None of our exploring party had ever been in the polar regions before, hence we all relied greatly on our ship captains�J. B. Douglas, commanding the brig Arkham, and serving as commander of the sea party, and Georg Thorfinnssen, commanding the barque Miskatonic both veteran whalers in antarctic waters. <br><br>As we left the inhabited world behind the sun sank lower and lower in the north, and stayed longer and longer above the horizon each day. At about 62� South Latitude we sighted our first icebergs�table-like objects with vertical sides and just before reaching the Antarctic Circle, which we crossed on October 20 with appropriately quaint ceremonies, we were considerably troubled with field ice. The falling temperature bothered me considerably after our long voyage through the tropics, but I tried to brace up for the worse rigours to come. On many occasions the curious atmospheric effects enchanted me vastly; these including a strikingly vivid miragethe first I had ever seen�in which distant bergs became the battlements of unimaginable cosmic castles. Pushing through the ice, which was fortunately neither extensive nor thickly packed, we regained open water at South Latitude 67�, East Longitude 175�. On the morning of October 26 a strong �land blink� appeared on the south, and before noon we all felt a thrill of excitement at beholding a vast, lofty, and snow-clad mountain chain which opened out and covered the whole vista ahead. At last we had encountered an outpost of the great unknown continent and its cryptic world of frozen death. These peaks were obviously the Admiralty Range discovered by Ross, and it would now be our task to round Cape Adare and sail down the east coast of Victoria Land to our contemplated base on the shore of McMurdo Sound at the foot of the volcano Erebus in South Latitude 77� 9�. The last lap of the voyage was vivid and fancy-stirring, great barren peaks of mystery looming up constantly against the west as the low northern sun of noon or the still lower horizon-grazing southern sun of midnight poured its hazy reddish rays over the white snow, bluish ice and water lanes, and black bits of exposed granite slope. <br><br>Through the desolate summits swept raging intermittent gusts of the terrible antarctic wind; whose cadences sometimes held vague suggestions of a wild and half-sentient musical piping, with notes extending over a wide range, and which for some subconscious mnemonic reason seemed to me disquieting and even dimly terrible. Something about the scene reminded me of the strange and disturbing Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich, and of the still stranger and more disturbing descriptions of the evilly fabled plateau of Leng which occur in the dreaded Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred. I was rather sorry, later on, that I had ever looked into that monstrous book at the college library. On the seventh of November, sight of the westward range having been temporarily lost, we passed Franklin Island; and the next day descried the cones of Mts. Erebus and Terror on Ross Island ahead, with the long line of the Parry Mountains beyond. There now stretched off to the east the low, white line of the great ice barrier; rising perpendicularly to a height of 200 feet like the rocky cliffs of Quebec, and marking the end of southward navigation. In the afternoon we entered McMurdo Sound and stood off the coast in the lee of smoking Mt. Erebus. The scoriac peak towered up some 12,700 feet against the eastern sky, like a Japanese print of the sacred Fujiyama; while beyond it rose the white, ghost-like height of Mt. Terror, 10,900 feet in altitude, and now extinct as a volcano. Puffs of smoke from Erebus came intermittently, and one of the graduate assistantsa brilliant young fellow named Danforth pointed out what looked like lava on the snowy slope; remarking that this mountain, discovered in 1840, had undoubtedly been the source of Poe's image when he wrote seven years later of the lavas that restlessly roll Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek In the ultimate climes of the pole� That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek In the realms of the boreal pole.� Danforth was a great reader of bizarre material, and had talked a good deal of Poe. <br><br>I was interested myself because of the antarctic scene of Poe's only long story the disturbing and enigmatical Arthur Gordon Pym. On the barren shore, and on the lofty ice barrier in the background, myriads of grotesque penguins squawked and flapped their fins; while many fat seals were visible on the water, swimming or sprawling across large cakes of slowly drifting ice. Using small boats, we effected a difficult landing on Ross Island shortly after midnight on the morning of the 9th, carrying a line of cable from each of the ships and preparing to unload supplies by means of a breeches-buoy arrangement. Our sensations on first treading antarctic soil were poignant and complex, even though at this particular point the Scott and Shackleton expeditions had preceded us. Our camp on the frozen shore below the volcano's slope was only a provisional one; headquarters being kept aboard the Arkham. We landed all our drilling apparatus, dogs, sledges, tents, provisions, gasoline tanks, experimental ice-melting outfit, cameras both ordinary and a&#x2018;rial, a&#x2018;roplane parts, and other accessories, including three small portable wireless outfits (besides those in the planes) capable of communicating with the Arkham's large outfit from any part of the antarctic continent that we would be likely to visit. The ship's outfit, communicating with the outside world, was to convey press reports to the Arkham Advertiser's powerful wireless station on Kingsport Head, Mass. We hoped to complete our work during a single antarctic summer; but if this proved impossible we would winter on the Arkham, sending the Miskatonic north before the freezing of the ice for another summer's supplies. <br><br> I need not repeat what the newspapers have already published about our early work: of our ascent of Mt. Erebus; our successful mineral borings at several points on Ross Island and the singular speed with which Pabodie's apparatus accomplished them, even through solid rock layers; our provisional test of the small ice-melting equipment; our perilous ascent of the great barrier with sledges and supplies; and our final assembling of five huge a&#x2018;roplanes at the camp atop the barrier. The health of our land partytwenty men and 55 Alaskan sledge dogs was remarkable, though of course we had so far encountered no really destructive temperatures or windstorms. For the most part, the thermometer varied between zero and 20� or 25� above, and our experience with New England winters had accustomed us to rigours of this sort. The barrier camp was semi-permanent, and destined to be a storage cache for gasoline, provisions, dynamite, and other supplies. Only four of our planes were needed to carry the actual exploring material, the fifth being left with a pilot and two men from the ships at the storage cache to form a means of reaching us from the Arkham in case all our exploring planes were lost. Later, when not using all the other planes for moving apparatus, we would employ one or two in a shuttle transportation service between this cache and another permanent base on the great plateau from 600 to 700 miles southward, beyond Beardmore Glacier. Despite the almost unanimous accounts of appalling winds and tempests that pour down from the plateau, we determined to dispense with intermediate bases; taking our chances in the interest of economy and probable efficiency. Wireless reports have spoken of the breath-taking four-hour nonstop flight of our squadron on November 21 over the lofty shelf ice, with vast peaks rising on the west, and the unfathomed silences echoing to the sound of our engines. Wind troubled us only moderately, and our radio compasses helped us through the one opaque fog we encountered. When the vast rise loomed ahead, between Latitudes 83� and 84�, we knew we had reached Beardmore Glacier, the largest valley glacier in the world, and that the frozen sea was now giving place to a frowning and mountainous coast-line. At last we were truly entering the white, aeon-dead world of the ultimate south, and even as we realised it we saw the peak of Mt.

In his own lifetime, Franklin knew prominence not only in America but also in Britain and France. Here was a cosmopolitan statesman, public servant, inventor, and editor with a distinctly Yankee sensibility; here was a moral philosopher who divided his faith between the natural sciences and the American experiment. <br><br>This volume includes Franklin's reflections on such diverse issues as reason and religion, social status, electricity, America's national character and characters, war, and the societal status of women. Also included is a new transcription of his 1726 journal, and several pieces that have only recently been identified as Franklin's work.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

You may remember the inquiries I made among the remains of my relations when you were with me in England, and the journey I undertook for that purpose. Imagining it may be equally agreeable to you to know the circumstances of my life, many of which you are yet unacquainted with, and expecting the enjoyment of a week's uninterrupted leisure in my present country retirement, I sit down to write them for you. To which I have besides some other inducements. Having emerged from the poverty and obscurity in which I was born and bred, to a state of affluence and some degree of reputation in the world, and having gone so far through life with a considerable share of felicity, the conducing means I made use of, which with the blessing of God so well succeeded, my posterity may like to know, as they may find some of them suitable to their own situations, and therefore fit to be imitated. <br> <br>That felicity, when I reflected on it, has induced me sometimes to say, that were it offered to my choice, I should have no objection to a repetition of the same life from its beginning, only asking the advantages authors have in a second edition to correct some faults of the first. So I might, besides correcting the faults, change some sinister accidents and events of it for others more favorable. But though this were denied, I should still accept the offer. Since such a repetition is not to be expected, the next thing most like living one's life over again seems to be a recollection of that life, and to make that recollection as durable as possible by putting it down in writing. <br> <br>Hereby, too, I shall indulge the inclination so natural in old men, to be talking of themselves and their own past actions; and I shall indulge it without being tiresome to others, who, through respect to age, might conceive themselves obliged to give me a hearing, since this may be read or not as any one pleases. And, lastly (I may as well confess it, since my denial of it will be believed by nobody), perhaps I shall a good deal gratify my own vanity. Indeed, I scarce ever heard or saw the introductory words, Without vanity I may say, etc., but some vain thing immediately followed. Most people dislike vanity in others, whatever share they have of it themselves; but I give it fair quarter wherever I meet with it, being persuaded that it is often productive of good to the possessor, and to others that are within his sphere of action; and therefore, in many cases, it would not be altogether absurd if a man were to thank God for his vanity among the other comforts of life. <br> <br>And now I speak of thanking God, I desire with all humility to acknowledge that I owe the mentioned happiness of my past life to His kind providence, which led me to the means I used and gave them success. My belief of this induces me to hope, though I must not presume, that the same goodness will still be exercised toward me, in continuing that happiness, or enabling me to bear a fatal reverse, which I may experience as others have done; the complexion of my future fortune being known to Him only in whose power it is to bless to us even our afflictions. <br> <br>The notes of one of my uncles (who had the same kind of curiosity in collecting family anecdotes) once put into my hands furnished me with several particulars relating to our ancestors. From these notes I learned that the family had lived in the same village, Ecton, in Northamptonshire, for three hundred years, and how much longer he knew not (perhaps from the time when the name of Franklin, that before was the name of an order of people, was assumed by them as a surname when others took surnames all over the kingdom),* on a freehold of about thirty acres, aided by the smith's business, which had continued in the family till his time, the eldest son being always bred to that business, a custom which he and my father followed as to their eldest sons. When I searched the registers at Ecton, I found an account of their births, marriages, and burials, from the year 1555 only, there being no registers kept in that parish at any time preceding. By that register, I perceived that I was the youngest son of the youngest son for five generations back. My grandfather Thomas, who was born in 1598, lived at Ecton till he grew too old to follow business longer, when he went to live with his son John, a dyer at Banbury, in Oxfordshire, with whom my father served an apprenticeship. There my grandfather died and lies buried. We saw his gravestone in 1758. His eldest son Thomas lived in the house at Ecton, and left it with the land to his only child, a daughter, who, with her husband, one Richard Fisher, of Wellingborough, sold it to Mr. Isted, now lord of the manor there. My grandfather had four sons that grew up, viz.: Thomas, John, Benjamin, and Josiah. I will give you what account I can of them at this distance from my papers, and if these are not lost in my absence, you will among them find many more particulars. <br> <br>Thomas was bred a smith under his father, but being ingenious, and encouraged in learning (as all my brothers were) by an Esquire Palmer, then the principal gentleman in that parish, he qualified himself for the business of scrivener,* became a considerable man in the county, was a chief mover of all public-spirited undertakings for the county or town of Northampton, and his own village, of which many instances were related of him, and much taken notice of and patronized by the then Lord Halifax. He died in 1702, January 6, old style, just four years to a day before I was born. The account we received of his life and character from some old people at Ecton, I remember, struck you as something extraordinary, from its similarity to what you knew of mine. "Had he died on the same day," you said, "one might have supposed a transmigration." <br> <br>John was bred a dyer, I believe, of woolens. Benjamin was bred a silk dyer, serving an apprenticeship at London. He was an ingenious man. I remember him well, for, when I was a boy, he came over to my father in Boston, and lived in the house with us some years. He lived to a great age. His grandson, Samuel Franklin, now lives in Boston. He left behind him two quarto volumes. MS., of his own poetry, consisting of little occasional pieces addressed to his friends and relations, of which the following, sent to me, is a specimen.* He had formed a shorthand of his own, which he taught me, but, never practicing it, I have now forgot it. I was named after this uncle, there being a particular affection between him and my father. He was very pious, a great attender of sermons of the best preachers, which he took down in his shorthand, and had with him many volumes of them. He was also much of a politician; too much, perhaps, for his station. There fell lately into my hands in London a collection he had made of all the principal pamphlets relating to public affairs, from 1641 to 1717; many of the volumes are wanting, as appears by the numbering, but there still remain eight volumes in folio, and twenty-four in quarto and in octavo. A dealer in old books met with them, and knowing me by my sometimes buying of him, he brought them to me. It seems my uncle must have left them here when he went to America, which was above fifty years since. There are many of his notes in the margins. <br> <br>This obscure family of ours was early in the Reformation, and continued Protestants through the reign of Queen Mary, when they were sometimes in danger of trouble on account of their zeal against popery. They had got an English Bible, and to conceal and secure it, it was fastened open with tapes under and within the cover of a joint-stool.* When my great-great-grandfather read it to his family, he turned up the joint-stool upon his knees, turning over the leaves then under the tapes. One of the children stood at the door to give notice if he saw the apparitor coming, who was an officer of the spiritual court. In that case the stool was turned down again upon its feet, when the Bible remained concealed under it as before. This anecdote I had from my uncle Benjamin. The family continued all of the Church of England till about the end of Charles the Second's reign, when some of the ministers that had been outed for nonconformity, holding conventicles* in Northamptonshire, Benjamin and Josiah adhered to them, and so continued all their lives: the rest of the family remained with the Episcopal Church. <br> <br>Josiah, my father, married young, and carried his wife with three children into New England, about 1682. The conventicles having been forbidden by law, and frequently disturbed, induced some considerable men of his acquaintance to remove to that country, and he was prevailed with to accompany them thither, where they expected to enjoy their mode of religion with freedom. By the same wife he had four children more; born there, and by a second wife ten more, in all seventeen; of which I remember thirteen sitting at one time at his table, who all grew up to be men and women, and married; I was the youngest son, and the youngest child but two, and was born in Boston, New England. My mother, the second wife, was Abiah Folger, daughter of Peter Folger, one of the first settlers of New England, of whom honorable mention is made by Cotton Mather, in his church history of that country entitled Magnalia Christi Americana, as "a godly, learned Englishman," if I remember the words rightly. I have heard that he wrote sundry small occasional pieces, but only one of them was printed, which I saw now many years since. It was written in 1675, in the homespun verse of that time and people, and addressed to those then concerned in the government there. It was in favor of liberty of conscience, and in behalf of the Baptists, Quakers, and other sectaries that had been under persecution, ascribing the Indian wars, and other distresses that had befallen the country, to that persecution, as so many judgments of God to punish so heinous an offense, and exhorting a repe...</p><h2>Strategic Planning for Public and Nonprofit Organizations: A Guide to Strengthening and Sustaining Organizational Achievement</h2><p>How can leaders use strategic planning to strengthen their public and nonprofit organizations?

The sights, sounds, even the smells of the farm are evoked amid the minutia of Gibbons&#39;s details. The very sounds of the words have as much effect as the tale they tell. Gibbons&#39;s use of melodrama popular in the early 1900&#39;s, to tell a romantic tale while simultaneously satirizing the genre, makes Massey&#39;s job more challenging. She manages quite well. The resurrection of the farm from brooding ineffectuality to normal human activity is worth listening to over and over. D.P.D. (c)AudioFile, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Saul Bellow: Novels 1944-1953: Dangling Man, The Victim, and The Adventures of Augie March (Library of America)</h2><p>Winner of the Nobel Prize and a towering figure of twentieth-century literature, Saul Bellow secured his place as one of the most distinctive and significant writers of the postwar era with the publication of his third novel,&nbsp;<i>The Adventures of Augie March</i>. This Library of America volume collects all three of Bellow&#x2019;s early works, beginning with&nbsp;<i>Dangling Man</i>&nbsp;(1944), an incisive character study cast in the form of a diary that depicts the anguish and uncertainty of a man known only as Joseph. Expecting to be deployed to the war overseas, Joseph quits his job and finds himself increasingly on edge when his draft board defers his enlistment. The first of his many books to take place in Chicago,&nbsp;<i>Dangling Man</i>&nbsp;is a spare, haunting novel in which Bellow lays bare Joseph&#x2019;s dilemma with rigorous precision and subtlety.<br><br><i>The Victim</i>&nbsp;(1947), which Bellow described as &#x201c;a novel whose theme is guilt,&#x201d; is an unsettling moral parable. Left alone in New York City while his wife is visiting her family, Asa Leventhal is confronted by a former co-worker whom he can barely remember. What seems like a chance encounter evolves into an uncanny bond that threatens to ruin Leventhal&#x2019;s life.

Conceived by acclaimed novelist Walter Mosley and sponsored by the New York University Africana Studies Program and the Institute of African American Affairs, this book originated as a series of community conversations where "visionaries with solutions" shared powerful views on personal and communal struggles, triumphs, and aspirations. The list of contributors suggests the range of perspectives and talents brought to bear on such issues as economics, political power, work, authority, and culture. <em>Black Genius</em> is a point of departure for vigorous discussion of our current realities and goals for the future-and a portrait of "genius" that leads the way to enriching American life in the twenty-first century.</p><p>These essays are taken from a symposium held in New York University's Africana Studies Program, whose participants included gifted writers and thinkers from the upper echelon of Afro-American achievement. The organizer, novelist Walter Mosley, writes, "The intent of <i>Black Genius</i> was to assemble a group of black intellectuals, artists, political activists, economists who have broken the visor and seen beyond the fallacies of race.... We wanted to present the stories of women and men who had made it in spite of the system." Farai Chideya delivers an on-point analysis of the media's misrepresentation of blacks and offers a blueprint for more up-front and behind-the-scenes representation in the newsroom. Critic Stanley Crouch body-slams the negroidal nihilism and black "gansta" mentality in rap music, while Angela Davis delivers a nightmarish assessment of the growing African American prison population. Others--including Julianne Malveaux, Randall Robinson, Spike Lee, and Anna Deveare Smith--take aim at health, the film industry, Wall Street, and the state of African-descended people around the world. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i><p><strong>Regina Austin</strong> is William A.

A key component is creating a classroom in which discourse is encouraged and leads to better understanding.

A collection of amazing photography of snow crystals using a unique system designed to take super-detailed micro images of these miniature ice masterpieces, &#34;The Snowflake&#34; is an extraordinary look at a seemingly ordinary object. Author Kenneth Libbrecht, a physics professor at Caltech and the pre-eminent snow-crystal researcher, discusses the physics and mythology of snow and how snow crystals are made. Photographer Patricia Rasmussen presents remarkable color micro-photography of snowflakes, and also discusses the history of snow-crystal micro-photography as invented by farmer Wilson Bentley.</p><p>Dr. Kenneth Libbrecht is a professor of physics at Caltech, where he studies how crystals grow. His books include <i>Ken Libbrecht&#x2019;s Field Guide to Snowflakes</i>, <i>The Art of the Snowflake</i>, and others. His latest news and views about snowflakes can be found at his website, www.SnowCrystals.com.Physicist Libbrecht and photographer Rasmussen both grew up in snowy climes, but it took a scientific and aesthetic focus to deepen their appreciation for snow's hidden beauty, revelations they now share in a felicitous union of word and image. Libbrecht decodes the exquisite architecture of individual snowflakes by explaining how these "miniature ice masterpieces" are literally conjured out of thin air as water vapor condenses into ice in shapes dictated by the geometry of water molecules. Temperature, humidity, and motion all contribute to the forming of snow crystals, which shape-shift rapidly from simple faceted structures to complex branching forms, growing and falling at the rate of a million billion crystals a second. The physics of snow crystals is fascinating, and so, too, is Libbrecht's history of the science of snowflakes, which features Rene Descartes; Johannes Kepler; Vermont farmer Wilson Bentley, who pioneered a method for photographing individual snowflakes; and physicist Ukichiro Nakaya, who figured out how to grow them. And then there are Rasmussen's exquisite photographs of these gems. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This collection of biographies disproves the great fallacy that a true scientist cannot simultaneously be a true man of God, believing in God as Creator and Savior and believing the Bible as God's revelation. In fact the history of science reveals notable Christians were actually the founding fathers of the scientific method and modern scientific disciplines.</p> <p>Each brief biography reveals the work, discoveries and personalities of celebrated historical figures of science who were also believers in God. Morris summarizes their major scientific accomplishments and details about their Christian faith in one to four short paragraphs. The biographies are arranged chronologically from 1452-1979.</p> <p>This book is a beacon of light illuminating the grand truth that the Bible and science are certainly compatible. Each biography will strengthen your faith and your admiration of how God uses individuals to accomplish incredible things. One quick glance at the appendix offering a list of key contributions of Bible-believing scientists of the past will fill you with awe and confidence in God. Allow Morris' book to inspire you to achieve great things that will bring Him honor and glory in a world desperate to see Him.</p> <p>Use <em>Men of Science, Men of God</em> to inform your own defense of the infallible Word of God.

Scientists have long supported this assumption by claiming that emotions are hardwired in the body or the brain. Today, however, the science of emotion is in the midst of a revolution on par with the discovery of relativity in physics and natural selection in biology--and this paradigm shift has far-reaching implications for us all.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Leading the charge is psychologist and neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett, whose theory of emotion is driving a deeper understanding of the mind and brain, and shedding new light on what it means to be human. Her research overturns the widely held belief that emotions are housed in different parts of the brain and are universally expressed and recognized. Instead, she has shown that emotion is constructed in the moment, by core systems that interact across the whole brain, aided by a lifetime of learning. This new theory means that you play a much greater role in your emotional life than you ever thought. Its repercussions are already shaking the foundations not only of psychology but also of medicine, the legal system, child-rearing, meditation, and even airport security.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Why do emotions feel automatic? Does rational thought really control emotion? How does emotion affect disease? How can you make your children more emotionally intelligent? <i>How Emotions Are Made</i>&nbsp;answers these questions and many more, revealing the latest research and intriguing practical applications of the new science of emotion, mind, and brain.&nbsp;</p><p>LISA FELDMAN BARRETT, Ph.D., is a University Distinguished Professor of Psychology at Northeastern University, with appointments at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital in Psychiatry and Radiology.

She offers an unintuitive theory that goes against not only the popular understanding but also that of traditional research: emotions don&#x2019;t arise; rather, we construct them on the fly. Furthermore, emotions are neither universal nor located in specific brain regions; they vary by culture and result from dynamic neuronal networks. These networks run nonstop simulations, making predictions and correcting them based on the environment rather than reacting to it. Tracing her own journey from the classical view of emotions, Barrett progressively builds her case, writing in a conversational tone and using down-to-earth metaphors, relegating the heaviest neuroscience to an appendix to keep the book accessible. Still, it is a lot to take in if one has not been exposed to these ideas before. VERDICT The theories of emotion and the human brain set forth here are revolutionary and have important implications.

Emotions do not reside in dedicated brain areas, constantly at war with areas charged with cognition or perception, as Pixar caricatured it in <i>Inside out</i>, let alone the brain described by Descartes or Plato or other philosophers. &nbsp;&nbsp;Nor does the brain passively retrieve data from &#x201c;outside&#x201d; to which it reacts. The brain constructs the reality it perceives, and the emotions it (and we) experience, using&nbsp; core brain systems, not specialized circuits. And it does so in concert with other brains, with the culture surrounding it.&nbsp; The implications of this work ('only'&nbsp;challenging two thousand year old assumptions about the brain) and its ambitions are nothing short of stunning.&nbsp; Even more stunning is how extraordinarily well it succeeds.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Nancy Gertner, Senior Lecturer on Law, Harvard Law School, and former U.S. federal judge for the United States District Court of Massachusetts</b></p><h2>Statistics for Business &amp; Economics, Revised (with XLSTAT Education Edition Printed Access Card)</h2><p>Get more out of your statistics course than simply solving equations.

The brilliant and gifted G. K. Chesterton was no exception, and the entertaining short stories in this volume revolve around just such an institution. In <i>The Club of Queer Trades</i>, candidates qualify for admission by creating a thoroughly original profession and proving they can make a living from it.<br>Six marvelously funny episodes with improbable plots are made especially pleasurable through Chesterton's vivid descriptions of late Victorian London, sly pokes at the legal system, and a characteristic gift for delicious nonsense. In each story, a bizarre crime &#x2014; such as kidnapping of a respected clergyman in "The Awful Reason of the Vicar's Visit" &#x2014; seems in the process of being committed. Actually, the events are all frenzied activities traceable to club members or would-be members. Here are intriguing tales of a little old lady imprisoned in a gloomy private dungeon; of prim and proper matrons bent on committing evil deeds; of a former British army officer and his extremely unusual residence; and a host of other incredible characters and situations.<br>Admirers of Chesterton's work will be delighted to learn that this edition contains all 32 of the author's own original illustrations &#x2014; the first republication to do so. In addition, a new Introduction on Chesterton's life and art and an appreciation of the special qualities of this work.</p><p>6 1-hour cassettesWidely known as the &#34;Prince of Paradox,&#34; G. K. Chesterton was one of the most influential English writers and thinkers of the 20th century. Chesterton&#39;s prodigious talents embraced a wide range of subjects, from philosophy and religion to detective fiction and fantasy. And while his writings are light and whimsical, they are filled with direct and honest truths.</p><h2>Listen</h2><p><p><b>Notice:<br>Kerman/Tomlinson, <i>Listen</i>, Eighth Edition is moving to W.W.

Today, health care organizations have almost universally embraced the strategic perspective first developed in the business sector and now have developed strategic management processes that are uniquely their own. Health care leaders have found that strategic thinking, planning, and managing strategic momentum are essential for coping with the dynamics of the health care industry. Strategic Management has become the single clearest manifestation of effective leadership of health care organizations.</p> <p>The 7 edition of this leading text has been revised and updated to include a greater focus on the global analysis of industry and competition; and analysis of the internal environment.</p> <p>It provides guidance on strategic planning, analysis of the health services environment (both internal and external) and lessons on implementation. It also looks at organizational capability, sustainability, CSR and the sources of organizational inertia and competency traps.</p></p><p><p>More than two decades ago, the authors agreed that the health care environment was experiencing evolutionary, and in some instances revolutionary, change and that only a structured strategic management approach, recognizing the value of strategic thinking, would make sense of the environment. <b><i>Strategic Management of Health Care Organizations</i></b> (1st edition 1992) became the leading authority in the US &#x2013; a highly successful text demonstrating the thought processes and activities for health care managers to become strategic thinkers with the critical skills to evaluate their fast-changing environment. Health care leaders have found that strategic thinking, strategic planning, and managing strategic momentum are essential for coping with the dynamics of the health care industry.</p> <p>Strategic management has become the single clearest manifestation for effective leadership of health care organizations. Now in its 7th edition, <b><i>Strategic Management for Health Care Organizations</i></b> continues to advocate the importance of strategic thinking and clearly differentiate strategic thinking, strategic planning, and managing strategic momentum.

He taught about what we call ecology, championed artistic creativity, and advocated for social, economic, and gender justice. All these elements have inspired spiritual maverick Matthew Fox and influenced his Creation Spirituality. Here, Fox creates metaphorical meetings between Eckhart and Teilhard de Chardin, Thich Nhat Hanh, Carl Jung, Black Elk, Rumi, Adrienne Rich, and other radical thinkers. The result is profoundly insightful, substantive, and inspiring.</p><p>The author of thirty books, <b>Matthew Fox</b> has been an instrumental teacher and scholar in the revival of Western mysticism, particularly the work of Hildegard of Bingen, Meister Eckhart, and Thomas Aquinas. Fox teaches and speaks widely and lives in Oakland, California.&#x201c;By connecting Eckhart&#x2019;s wisdom to the problems of today, Fox creates a sense of optimistic urgency; solutions do not wait in the future or lie in the past, but are present right now if people choose to act with compassion and conviction. The book is not only an excellent introduction to Eckhart&#x2019;s theology, but also an inspirational guidepost for connecting faith with activism.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; <em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br> <br> &#x201c;In this book Matthew Fox, one of the gigantic Christians of this century, engages and presents Meister Eckhart, one of the gigantic Christians of the ages, in dialogue with some of today&#x2019;s best minds. The result is a stunning new vision of Christianity that transcends both creeds and boundaries. It is a thrilling read.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; John Shelby Spong,</strong> author of <em>The Fourth Gospel: Tales of a Jewish Mystic</em><br> <br> &#x201c;Matthew Fox is perhaps the greatest writer on Meister Eckhart that has ever existed.

Fox brings Eckhart&#x2019;s voice into cogent meeting with a long list of pivotal global luminaries. Marrying these confluences may well determine the success or failure of our planet&#x2019;s inevitable process toward globalization and multiculturalism.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; Kurt Johnson,</strong> coauthor of <em>The Coming Interspiritual Age</em><br> <br> &#x201c;The special uniqueness of this book lies in Matthew Fox&#x2019;s ability to put a host of ancient and contemporary thinkers and social activists in close mutual relationship with Meister Eckhart. . . . With this book, Matthew Fox gives us an intimation that hope in the future is not some idle passing thought. That it is even possible to have written this book is a reminder that such spiritual searching and the worldwide diversity that accompanies it is more prevalent than one would think.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; Fred Gustafson,</strong> <em>Literary Aficionado</em></p><h2>Research Methods in the Social Sciences</h2><p>Using real-world examples, <em>Research Methods in the Social Sciences</em> illustrates the relevance of social sciences research in today's world.</p><p>Chava Frankfort-Nachmias is an Emeritus Professor of Sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs."</i><p> Meet Ignatius J. Reilly, the hero of John Kennedy Toole's tragicomic tale, <i>A Confederacy of Dunces</i>. This 30-year-old medievalist lives at home with his mother in New Orleans, pens his magnum opus on Big Chief writing pads he keeps hidden under his bed, and relays to anyone who will listen the traumatic experience he once had on a Greyhound Scenicruiser bound for Baton Rouge. ("Speeding along in that bus was like hurtling into the abyss.") But Ignatius's quiet life of tyrannizing his mother and writing his endless comparative history screeches to a halt when he is almost arrested by the overeager Patrolman Mancuso--who mistakes him for a vagrant--and then involved in a car accident with his tipsy mother behind the wheel. One thing leads to another, and before he knows it, Ignatius is out pounding the pavement in search of a job. </p><p> Over the next several hundred pages, our hero stumbles from one adventure to the next. His stint as a hotdog vendor is less than successful, and he soon turns his employers at the Levy Pants Company on their heads. Ignatius's path through the working world is populated by marvelous secondary characters: the stripper Darlene and her talented cockatoo; the septuagenarian secretary Miss Trixie, whose desperate attempts to retire are constantly, comically thwarted; gay blade Dorian Greene; sinister Miss Lee, proprietor of the Night of Joy nightclub; and Myrna Minkoff, the girl Ignatius loves to hate. The many subplots that weave through <i>A Confederacy of Dunces</i> are as complicated as anything you'll find in a Dickens novel, and just as beautifully tied together in the end. But it is Ignatius--selfish, domineering, and deluded, tragic and comic and larger than life--who carries the story. He is a modern-day Quixote beset by giants of the modern age. His fragility cracks the shell of comic bluster, revealing a deep streak of melancholy beneath the antic humor. John Kennedy Toole committed suicide in 1969 and never saw the publication of his novel. Ignatius Reilly is what he left behind, a fitting memorial to a talented and tormented life. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>When Walker Percy penned these prophetic words in his foreword to the first edition of A Confederacy of Dunces, he could not have known just how wide Toole's "world of readers" would become. Released by Louisiana State University Press in April 1980, A Confederacy of Dunces is nothing short of a publishing phenomenon. Turned down by countless publishers and submitted by the author's mother years after his suicide, the book won the 1981 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Today, there are over 1,500,000 copies in print worldwide in eighteen languages.<p>Toole's lunatic and sage novel introduces one of the most memorable characters in American literature, Ignatius Reilly, whom Percy dubs "slob extraordinary, a mad Oliver Hardy, a fat Don Quixote, a perverse Thomas Aquinas rolled into one -- who is in violent revolt against the entire modern age". Ignatius' ire explodes when his mother backs her car into another automobile. The owner of the damaged vehicle insists on payment; Mrs. Reilly demands that her son cease watching television and writing in his Big Chief tablet and get a job.</p><p>Set in New Orleans, A Confederacy of Dunces outswifts Swift, one of whose essays gives the book its title. As its characters burst into life, they leave the region and literature forever changed by their presences -- Ignatius and his mother; Miss Trixie, the octogenarian assistant accountant at Levy Pants; inept, wan Patrolman Mancuso; Darlene, the Bourbon Street stripper with a penchant for poultry; Jones, the jivecat in space-age dark glasses. Satire and farce animate A Confederacy of Dunces; tragic awareness ennobles it.</p><p>Louisiana State University Press celebrates A Confederacy of Dunces' twentieth year withthis anniversary edition, which includes a new introduction by Andrei Codrescu that examines the relationship of this modern-day classic to the city whose pulse it so brilliantly captures.</p></p><h2>The Age of Federalism - The Early American Republic, 1788 - 1800</h2><p>When Thomas Jefferson took the oath of office for the presidency in 1801, America had just passed through twelve critical years, years dominated by some of the towering figures of our history and by the challenge of having to do everything for the first time. Washington, Hamilton, Madison, Adams, and Jefferson himself each had a share in shaping that remarkable era--an era that is brilliantly captured in <em>The Age of Federalism</em>.<br> Written by esteemed historians Stanley Elkins and Eric McKitrick, <em>The Age of Federalism</em> gives us a reflective, deeply informed analytical survey of this extraordinary period. Ranging over the widest variety of concerns--political, cultural, economic, diplomatic, and military--the authors provide a sweeping historical account, keeping always in view not only the problems the new nation faced but also the particular individuals who tried to solve them. As they move through the Federalist era, they draw subtly perceptive character sketches not only of the great figures--Washington and Jefferson, Talleyrand and Napoleon Bonaparte--but also of lesser ones, such as George Hammond, Britain's frustrated minister to the United States, James McHenry, Adams's hapless Secretary of War, the pre-Chief Justice version of John Marshall, and others. They weave these lively profiles into an analysis of the central controversies of the day, turning such intricate issues as the public debt into fascinating depictions of opposing political strategies and contending economic philosophies. Each dispute bears in some way on the broader story of the emerging nation. The authors show, for instance, the consequences the fight over Hamilton's financial system had for the locating of the nation's permanent capital, and how it widened an ideological gulf between Hamilton and the Virginians, Madison and Jefferson, that became unbridgeable. The statesmen of the founding generation, the authors believe, did "a surprising number of things right." But Elkins and McKitrick also describe some things that went resoundingly wrong: the hopelessly underfinanced effort to construct a capital city on the Potomac (New York, they argue, would have been a far more logical choice than Washington), and prosecutions under the Alien and Sedition Acts which turned into a comic nightmare. No detail is left out, or left uninteresting, as their account continues through the Adams presidency, the XYZ affair, the naval Quasi-War with France, and the desperate Federalist maneuvers in 1800, first to prevent the reelection of Adams and then to nullify the election of Jefferson.<br> <em>The Age of Federalism</em> is the fruit of many years of discussion and thought, in which deep scholarship is matched only by the lucid distinction of its prose. With it, Stanley Elkins and Eric McKitrick have produced the definitive study, long awaited by historians, of the early national era.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stanley Elkins</strong> is the author of <em>Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life</em>, and is Professor of History at Smith College.<br><br><strong>Eric McKitrick</strong> is the author of <em>Andrew Johnson and Reconstruction</em>, and is Professor of History Emeritus at Columbia University.<br>"No historian, or pair of historians, is likely to do again what they have done....A truly remarkable book--a blockbuster of more than 750 pages of text plus 175 more pages of notes and index. It is not length that makes the book remarkable but its character and scope....All the great<br>characters of the period are insightfully portrayed in beautifully crafted vignettes....Sometimes in just a few pages or a few lines Elkins and McKitrick capture more about these characters than biographers have in whole volumes, and with more humor."--Atlantic Monthly<br><br>"Scholarly, engrossing, and complex"--The New Yorker<br><br>"An impressive achievement. Stanley Elkins and Eric McKitrick have produced an original, scholarly and sparkling account of this nation's first crucial decade under the Constitution.

Virtually every<br>issue, event or character that enters the story is examined with a scholarly thoroughness that will insure the volume's success as a reference tool for some time to come."--The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"A rare work that should appeal to lay readers and scholars alike. Its assessments of men and motives are shrewd, even biting, but balanced, and it recounts events and choices with admirable care."--The Chicago Tribune<br><br>"Two renowned historians apply their talents to the history of the United States during the administrations of George Washington and John Adams. It's all here--Hamilton's financial plans, the capital fight, the Jay crisis, the Quasi-War. But the book is much more than a mere chronicle of the<br>parties and politics of the period 1789-1801. The authors thoroughly embed their account in the political culture of the time. They explore America's dominant republican ideology more fully here than in any other source, making the book this generation's standard interpretive study....It will reward<br>even seasoned professionals with its insights, coverage, and reflections."--Library Journal<br><br>"Skillfully written and intensively researched."--Milwaukee Journal<br><br>"Among the many wonders of The Age of Federalism, Stanley Elkins and Eric McKitrick's panoramic record of the ermgence of modern politics in the US, is how these noted historians reconcile such contradictory accounts of America's national origin. By treating the messy business of politics as<br>equal to the high-toned struggles over constitutional philosophy, the authors allow readers to see how grand ideals cohabited with narrow self-interest in the minds of the Founders. One finishes this book with the sense that the men who created the American political order were both larger than life<br>and tragically flawed, sometimes far-sighted geniuses and sometimes blundering fools....[A] splendid book."--The Christian Science Monitor<br><br>"Any notions that the era from 1788 to 1800 lacked for consequence are thoroughly dispelled by this utterly absorbing account....Here are fresh readings of familiar figures from John Adams to George Washington, invigorating interpretations of items from 'The Federalist Papers' to the XYZ<br>Mission, reflective ideas on the nature of the democracy and the psychology of those who built it....This is profoundly insightful, instructive and entertaining political history."--The State, Columbia, South Carolina<br><br>"This magisterial, detailed history of the early American republic through 1800 reminds us that the 'Founding Fathers' were revolutionaries, full of volatile passions that cemented or shattered friendships and shaped their cultural orientations....Full of vibrant portraits of the Federalists<br>and their opponents, this outstanding, provocative chronicle sheds much new light on the emergence of American partisan politics."--Publishers Weekly</p><h2>Modelling and Sculpting Animals (Dover Art Instruction)</h2><p><p>"A joy to read, as well as a constant reference library.

I was obsessed with understanding how people cope with failures, and I decided to study it by watching how students grapple with hard problems. So I brought children one at a time to a room in their school, made them comfortable, and then gave them a series of puzzles to solve. The first ones were fairly easy, but the next ones were hard. As the students grunted, perspired, and toiled, I watched their strategies and probed what they were thinking and feeling. I expected differences among children in how they coped with the difficulty, but I saw something I never expected.<br><br> Confronted with the hard puzzles, one ten-year-old boy pulled up his chair, rubbed his hands together, smacked his lips, and cried out, &#x201c;I love a challenge!&#x201d; Another, sweating away on these puzzles, looked up with a pleased expression and said with authority, &#x201c;You know, I was hoping this would be informative!&#x201d;<br><br> What&#x2019;s wrong with them? I wondered. I always thought you coped with failure or you didn&#x2019;t cope with failure. I never thought anyone loved failure. Were these alien children or were they on to something?<br><br> Everyone has a role model, someone who pointed the way at a critical moment in their lives. These children were my role models. They obviously knew something I didn&#x2019;t and I was determined to figure it out&#x2014;to understand the kind of mindset that could turn a failure into a gift.<br><br> What did they know? They knew that human qualities, such as intellectual skills, could be cultivated through effort. And that&#x2019;s what they were doing&#x2014;getting smarter. Not only weren&#x2019;t they discouraged by failure, they didn&#x2019;t even think they were failing. They thought they were learning.<br><br> I, on the other hand, thought human qualities were carved in stone. You were smart or you weren&#x2019;t, and failure meant you weren&#x2019;t. It was that simple. If you could arrange successes and avoid failures (at all costs), you could stay smart. Struggles, mistakes, perseverance were just not part of this picture.<br><br> Whether human qualities are things that can be cultivated or things that are carved in stone is an old issue. What these beliefs mean for you is a new one: What are the consequences of thinking that your intelligence or personality is something you can develop, as opposed to something that is a fixed, deep-seated trait? Let&#x2019;s first look in on the age-old, fiercely waged debate about human nature and then return to the question of what these beliefs mean for you.<br><br> WHY DO PEOPLE DIFFER?<br><br> Since the dawn of time, people have thought differently, acted differently, and fared differently from each other. It was guaranteed that someone would ask the question of why people differed&#x2014;why some people are smarter or more moral&#x2014;and whether there was something that made them permanently different. Experts lined up on both sides. Some claimed that there was a strong physical basis for these differences, making them unavoidable and unalterable. Through the ages, these alleged physical differences have included bumps on the skull (phrenology), the size and shape of the skull (craniology), and, today, genes.<br><br> Others pointed to the strong differences in people&#x2019;s backgrounds, experiences, training, or ways of learning. It may surprise you to know that a big champion of this view was Alfred Binet, the inventor of the IQ test. Wasn&#x2019;t the IQ test meant to summarize children&#x2019;s unchangeable intelligence? In fact, no. Binet, a Frenchman working in Paris in the early twentieth century, designed this test to identify children who were not profiting from the Paris public schools, so that new educational programs could be designed to get them back on track. Without denying individual differences in children&#x2019;s intellects, he believed that education and practice could bring about fundamental changes in intelligence. Here is a quote from one of his major books, Modern Ideas About Children, in which he summarizes his work with hundreds of children with learning difficulties:<br><br> A few modern philosophers . . . assert that an individual&#x2019;s intelligence is a fixed quantity, a quantity which cannot be increased. We must protest and react against this brutal pessimism. . . . With practice, training, and above all, method, we manage to increase our attention, our memory, our judgment and literally to become more intelligent than we were before.<br><br> Who&#x2019;s right? Today most experts agree that it&#x2019;s not either&#x2013;or. It&#x2019;s not nature or nurture, genes or environment. From conception on, there&#x2019;s a constant give and take between the two. In fact, as Gilbert Gottlieb, an eminent neuroscientist, put it, not only do genes and environment cooperate as we develop, but genes require input from the environment to work properly.<br><br> At the same time, scientists are learning that people have more capacity for lifelong learning and brain development than they ever thought. Of course, each person has a unique genetic endowment. People may start with different temperaments and different aptitudes, but it is clear that experience, training, and personal effort take them the rest of the way. Robert Sternberg, the present-day guru of intelligence, writes that the major factor in whether people achieve expertise &#x201c;is not some fixed prior ability, but purposeful engagement.&#x201d; Or, as his forerunner Binet recognized, it&#x2019;s not always the people who start out the smartest who end up the smartest.<br><br> WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN FOR YOU? THE TWO MINDSETS<br><br> It&#x2019;s one thing to have pundits spouting their opinions about scientific issues. It&#x2019;s another thing to understand how these views apply to you. For twenty years, my research has shown that the view you adopt for yourself profoundly affects the way you lead your life. It can determine whether you become the person you want to be and whether you accomplish the things you value. How does this happen? How can a simple belief have the power to transform your psychology and, as a result, your life?<br><br> Believing that your qualities are carved in stone&#x2014;the fixed mindset&#x2014;creates an urgency to prove yourself over and over. If you have only a certain amount of intelligence, a certain personality, and a certain moral character&#x2014;well, then you&#x2019;d better prove that you have a healthy dose of them. It simply wouldn&#x2019;t do to look or feel deficient in these most basic characteristics.<br><br> Some of us are trained in this mindset from an early age. Even as a child, I was focused on being smart, but the fixed mindset was really stamped in by Mrs. Wilson, my sixth-grade teacher. Unlike Alfred Binet, she believed that people&#x2019;s IQ scores told the whole story of who they were. We were seated around the room in IQ order, and only the highest-IQ students could be trusted to carry the flag, clap the erasers, or take a note to the principal. Aside from the daily stomachaches she provoked with her judgmental stance, she was creating a mindset in which everyone in the class had one consuming goal&#x2014;look smart, don&#x2019;t look dumb. Who cared about or enjoyed learning when our whole being was at stake every time she gave us a test or called on us in class?<br><br> I&#x2019;ve seen so many people with this one consuming goal of proving themselves&#x2014;in the classroom, in their careers, and in their relationships. Every situation calls for a confirmation of their intelligence, personality, or character. Every situation is evaluated: Will I succeed or fail? Will I look smart or dumb? Will I be accepted or rejected? Will I feel like a winner or a loser?<br><br> But doesn&#x2019;t our society value intelligence, personality, and character? Isn&#x2019;t it normal to want these traits? Yes, but . . .<br><br> There&#x2019;s another mindset in which these traits are not simply a hand you&#x2019;re dealt and have to live with, always trying to convince yourself and others that you have a royal flush when you&#x2019;re secretly worried it&#x2019;s a pair of tens. In this mindset, the hand you&#x2019;re dealt is just the starting point for development. This growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts. Although people may differ in every which way&#x2014;in their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperaments&#x2014;everyone can change and grow through application and experience.<br><br> Do people with this mindset believe that anyone can be anything, that anyone with proper motivation or education can become Einstein or Beethoven? No, but they believe that a person&#x2019;s true potential is unknown (and unknowable); that it&#x2019;s impossible to foresee what can be accomplished with years of passion, toil, and training.<br><br> Did you know that Darwin and Tolstoy were considered ordinary children? That Ben Hogan, one of the greatest golfers of all time, was completely uncoordinated and graceless as a child? That the photographer Cindy Sherman, who has been on virtually every list of the most important artists of the twentieth century, failed her first photography course? That Geraldine Page, one of our greatest actresses, was advised to give it up for lack of talent?<br><br> You can see how the belief that cherished qualities can be developed creates a passion for learning. Why waste time proving over and over how great you are, when you could be getting better? Why hide deficiencies instead of overcoming them? Why look for friends or partners who will just shore up your self-esteem instead of ones who will also challenge you to grow? And why seek out the tried and true, instead of experiences that will stretch you? The passion for stretching yourself and sticking to it, even (or especially) when it&#x2019;s not going well, is the hallmark of the growth mindset. This is the mindset that allows people to thrive during some of the most challenging times in their lives.<br><br> A VIEW FROM THE TWO MINDSETS<br><br> To give you a better sense of how the two mindsets work, imagine&#x2014;as vividly as you can&#x2014;that you are a young adult having a really bad day:<br><br> One day, you go to a class that is really important to you and that you like a lot. The professor returns the midterm papers to the class. You got a C+. You&#x2019;re very disappointed. That evening on the way back to your home, you find that you&#x2019;ve gotten a parking ticket. Being really frustrated, you call your best friend to share your experience but are sort of brushed off.<br><br> What would you think? What would you feel? What would you do?<br><br> When I asked people with the fixed mindset, this is what they said: &#x201c;I&#x2019;d feel like a reject.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a total failure.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m an idiot.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a loser.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;d feel worthless and dumb&#x2014;everyone&#x2019;s better than me.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m slime.&#x201d; In other words, they&#x2019;d see what happened as a direct measure of their competence and worth.<br><br> This is what they&#x2019;d think about their lives: &#x201c;My life is pitiful.&#x201d; &#x201c;I have no life.&#x201d; &#x201c;Somebody upstairs doesn&#x2019;t like me.&#x201d; &#x201c;The world is out to get me.&#x201d; &#x201c;Someone is out to destroy me.&#x201d; &#x201c;Nobody loves me, everybody hates me.&#x201d; &#x201c;Life is unfair and all efforts are useless.&#x201d; &#x201c;Life stinks. I&#x2019;m stupid. Nothing good ever happens to me.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the most unlucky person on this earth.&#x201d;<br><br> Excuse me, was there death and destruction, or just a grade, a ticket, and a bad phone call?<br><br> Are these just people with low self-esteem? Or card-carrying pessimists? No. When they aren&#x2019;t coping with failure, they feel just as worthy and optimistic&#x2014;and bright and attractive&#x2014;as people with the growth mindset.<br><br> So how would they cope? &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t bother to put so much time and effort into doing well in anything.&#x201d; (In other words, don&#x2019;t let anyone measure you again.) &#x201c;Do nothing.&#x201d; &#x201c;Stay in bed.&#x201d; &#x201c;Get drunk.&#x201d; &#x201c;Eat.&#x201d; &#x201c;Yell at someone if I get a chance to.&#x201d; &#x201c;Eat chocolate.&#x201d; &#x201c;Listen to music and pout.&#x201d; &#x201c;Go into my closet and sit there.&#x201d; &#x201c;Pick a fight with somebody.&#x201d; &#x201c;Cry.&#x201d; &#x201c;Break something.&#x201d; &#x201c;What is there to do?&#x201d;<br><br> What is there to do! You know, when I wrote the vignette, I intentionally made the grade a C+, not an F. It was a midterm rather than a final. It was a parking ticket, not a car wreck. They were &#x201c;sort of brushed off,&#x201d; not rejected outright. Nothing catastrophic or irreversible happened. Yet from this raw material the fixed mindset created the feeling of utter failure and paralysis.<br><br> When I gave people with the growth mindset the same vignette, here&#x2019;s what they said. They&#x2019;d think:<br><br> &#x201c;I need to try harder in class, be more careful when parking the car, and wonder if my friend had a bad day.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The C+ would tell me that I&#x2019;d have to work a lot harder in the class, but I have the rest of the semester to pull up my grade.&#x201d;<br><br> There were many, many more like this, but I think you get the idea. Now, how would they cope? Directly.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;d start thinking about studying harder (or studying in a different way) for my next test in that class, I&#x2019;d pay the ticket, and I&#x2019;d work things out with my best friend the next time we speak.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;d look at what was wrong on my exam, resolve to do better, pay my parking ticket, and call my friend to tell her I was upset the day before.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Work hard on my next paper, speak to the teacher, be more careful where I park or contest the ticket, and find out what&#x2019;s wrong with my friend.&#x201d;<br><br> You don&#x2019;t have to have one mindset or the other to be upset. Who wouldn&#x2019;t be? Things like a poor grade or a rebuff from a friend or loved one&#x2014;these are not fun events. No one was smacking their lips with relish. Yet those people with the growth mindset were not labeling themselves and throwing up their hands. Even though they felt distressed, they were ready to take the risks, confront the challenges, and keep working at them.<br><br> SO, WHAT&#x2019;S NEW?<br><br> Is this such a novel idea? We have lots of sayings that stress the importance of risk and the power of persistence, such as &#x201c;Nothing ventured, nothing gained&#x201d; and &#x201c;If at first you don&#x2019;t succeed, try, try again&#x201d; or &#x201c;Rome wasn&#x2019;t built in a day.&#x201d; (By the way, I was delighted to learn that the Italians have the same expression.) What is truly amazing is that people with the fixed mindset would not agree. For them, it&#x2019;s &#x201c;Nothing ventured, nothing lost.&#x201d; &#x201c;If at first you don&#x2019;t succeed, you probably don&#x2019;t have the ability.&#x201d; &#x201c;If Rome wasn&#x2019;t built in a day, maybe it wasn&#x2019;t meant to be.&#x201d; In other words, risk and effort are two things that might reveal your inadequacies and show that you were not up to the task. In fact, it&#x2019;s startling to see the degree to which people with the fixed mindset do not believe in effort.</p><h2>The Out-of-Sync Child has Fun: Activities for Kids with Sensory Integration Dysfunction</h2><p>The companion volume to The Out-of-Sync Child presents a wide range of games, activities, and exercises designed to help parents of children with Sensory Integration Dysfunction strengthen their child&#39;s abilities.

The research is wide-ranging. Much of it is new. Above all, Banerjee and Duflo take the poorest billion people as they find them. There is no wishful thinking. The attitude is straightforward and honest, occasionally painfully so. And some of the conclusions are surprising, even disconcerting.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>Forbes.com</i>, April 25, 2011</b>&#x201c;a compelling and important read... an honest and readable account about the poor that stands a chance of actually yielding results.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>Philanthropy Action</i>, April 25, 2011<br></b>&#x201c;Banerjee and Duflo write exceptionally well, and given that there are two of them, the voice is surprisingly singular. But the real surprise in this book is its humility. Both the authors and the material they pull from are truly formidable, yet Banerjee and Duflo are not really out to make a hard pitch, least of all to die-hard Big Idealists who disagree with them. As such, there is nothing directly confrontational about <i>Poor Economics</i>. They are peeling the onion, not hacking it to pieces.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Esther Duflo won the John Bates Clark medal last year for her work on development economics, so I was excited to read her new book with Abhijit Banerjee <i>Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty</i>. It&#x2019;s a good book. It doesn&#x2019;t really contain a radical rethinking of the way to fight global poverty, but it does try to cut past lame debates over whether or not foreign aid &#x201c;works&#x201d; to instead attempt to find ways to actually assess which programs are working, which aren&#x2019;t, and how to improve those that don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><b>, April 30, 2011</b>&#x201c;Marvelous, rewarding...&#x2019;<i>More Than Good Intentions</i>&#x2019; and &#x2018;<i>Poor Economics</i>&#x2019; are marked by their deep appreciation of the precariousness that colors the lives of poor people as they tiptoe along the margin of survival. But I would give an edge to Mr. Banerjee and Ms. Duflo in this area&#x2014;the sheer detail and warm sympathy on display reflects a true appreciation of the challenges their subjects face... They have fought to establish a beachhead of honesty and rigor about evidence, evaluation and complexity in an aid world that would prefer to stick to glossy brochures and celebrity photo-ops. For this they deserve to be congratulated&#x2014;and to be read.&#x201d;<b><i><br> Financial Times</i></b><b>, April 30, 2011</b><br><br>&#x201c; &#x2019;Poor Economics&#x2019; moves beyond all the bluster of development theories crafted in fancy rooms and actually examines at close range the rational economic decisions made by folks living on less than one dollar each day. A lot of aid, the book argues, is hampered for the same reason that some businesses are: ideology, inertia and ignorance. And the book compares the very poor to very rich hedge fund managers -- always wrestling with risk, but with almost no margin for error. "Poor Economics" tells us why micro finance may squash entrepreneurial risk taking and that filling the funding gap for medium-sized businesses is the next big challenge facing all those who want to foster entrepreneurship and spur growth around the world.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<b>Foreign Affairs</b>&#x201c;Throughout their book, Banerjee and Duflo examine all facets of the behavior of the poor through this microscopic lens and discuss how certain types of interventions can make things better. They unapologetically propose a solution they acknowledge to be paternalistic: outside interventions by those who know best. But that type of policy makes sense only after detailed investigations of the conditions under which the interventions will occur, and Banerjee and Duflo are careful to tailor their recommendations to the circumstances on the ground.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>Bloomberg Business Week</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The ingenuity of these experiments aside, it is the rich and humane portrayal of the lives of the very poor that most impresses.

Instead they appeal to many local observations and experiments to explore how poor people in poor countries actually cope with their poverty: what they know, what they seem (or don't seem) to want, what they expect of themselves and others, and how they make the choices that they can make. Apparently there are plenty of small but meaningful victories to be won, some through private and some through public action, that together could add up to a large gains for the world's poor, and might even start a ball rolling.

In 1929, she began spending part of almost every year painting there, first in Taos, and subsequently in and around Alcalde, Abiquiu, and Ghost Ranch, with occasional excursions to remote sites she found particularly compelling. <i>Georgia O'Keeffe and New Mexico</i> is the first book to analyze the artist's famous depictions of these Southwestern landscapes.</p><br><p> Beautifully illustrated and gracefully written, the book accompanies an exhibition of the same name at the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico. It reproduces the exhibition's 50 paintings and includes striking photographs of the sites that inspired them as well as diagrams of the region's distinctive geology. The book examines the magnificence of O'Keeffe's work through essays by three noted authors. Barbara Buhler Lynes, Curator of the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum and organizer of the exhibition, discusses the relationship of the artist's paintings to the places that inspired her.</p><br><p> Frederick Turner offers an illuminating essay contrasting O'Keeffe's fabled aloofness from the well-established art colony in Santa Fe with her intense closeness to the local landscape she so fiercely loved. Lesley Poling-Kempes furnishes a fascinating chronicle of O'Keeffe's years in the region as well as a useful explanation of the geological forces that produced the intense colors and dramatic shapes of the landscapes O'Keeffe painted.</p><br><p> <b>EXHIBIT SCHEDULE:</b><br> ?</p><br><br><p> Georgia O'Keeffe Museum</p><p>Santa Fe, New Mexico<br>June 11-September 12, 2004</p><br><br><p> Columbus Museum of Art</p><p>Columbus, Ohio<br>October 1, 2004-January 16, 2005</p><br><br><p> Albright-Knox Art Gallery</p><p>Buffalo, New York<br>January 28-May 08, 2005</p></p><p><p>"This book will significantly contribute to our understanding of this phase of O'Keeffe's life and accomplishments. Lynes' essay, in particular, opens up a new aspect of the artist's work. She revisits the landscapes that inspired much of O'Keeffe's artistry, comparing each carefully with its corresponding painted rendition. She discovers how the artist walks the fine line between specific observation and playful abstraction. Her careful consideration of each pictorial structure makes us see the lengths to which O'Keeffe went in order to make these landscape forms speak to her."<b>--Kathleen Pyne, University of Notre Dame</b></p><b>Barbara Buhler Lynes</b> is Curator, Georgia O'Keeffe Museum, and The Emily Fisher Landau Director, Georgia O'Keeffe Museum Research Center, Santa Fe, New Mexico.

Sophie goes to school for the first time and has no interest in making friends that aren&#x2019;t squash. Here&#x2019;s a gently humorous read-aloud that proves that making friends, just like growing squash, takes time. <br> &nbsp;<br> On Sophie&#x2019;s first day of school, nobody appreciates her two best friends, Bonnie and Baxter, baby squash that she grew in her garden. Even worse, one classmate, Steven Green, won&#x2019;t leave Sophie alone. He sits by her at circle time. He plays near her during recess. And he breathes on her while she paints. Steven just wants to be friends, but Sophie isn&#x2019;t interested. Still, Sophie knows that her squash friends won&#x2019;t last forever. Maybe it would be nice to have some human friends after all. . . .</p><p>Pat Zietlow Miller received an Ezra Jack Keats New Writer Honor for <i>Sophie&#x2019;s Squash,</i> her picture-book debut, which was published to four starred reviews and named a Charlotte Zolotow Honor Book.

When readers last encountered the stubborn protagonist of Sophie's Squash, the girl's beloved Bernice was becoming freckled with spots and mushy. On the advice of the farmer, Sophie provides Bernice with fresh air, clean soil, and love (the squash gets buried by its favorite outdoor spot). Along with the arrival of the warm weather, a sprout appears, and, ultimately, Bernice's two offspring arrive. Now Sophie is starting school, and with her go the small fruits named Bonnie and Baxter. Once there, the kindergartner encounters and vehemently rebuffs the friendly overtures of the persistent Steven Green (who carries around a frog). Slowly, the classroom activities and outdoor games of her classmates begin to attract Sophie's interest, but it isn't until Bonnie and Baxter are tucked in for their "winter nap" and her teacher's question, "What makes a good friend?", followed by a tussle with Steven, an apology, and a plan, that she realizes that friends come in all forms, including human. Young children will relate to Sophie's unease in a new environment and her difficulty letting go of the familiar and comforting. Wilsdorf's watercolor and ink art, filled with details, depict a colorful classroom complete with art projects, books, blocks, and enough activity (and humor) to tempt the most reluctant of preschoolers to give kindergarten a try.

Parker: Author One-on-One</strong><br> In this Amazon exclusive, we brought together blockbuster authors Sue Grafton and Robert B. Parker and asked them to interview each other. <br></p> <p>Sue Grafton is the <em>New York Times</em>-bestselling author of the beloved Kinsey Millhone mystery series, which continues to delight millions of readers across the globe. Read on to see Sue Grafton's questions for Robert B. Parker, or turn the tables to see what Parker asked Grafton.</p> <strong>Grafton</strong>: During your career, you've generally worked as a solo writer. Aside from your collaboration with Raymond Chandler (quite dead), how did you enjoy the experience of writing with your wife, Joan? I notice a long break between <em>Three Weeks in Spring</em>, which was published in 1978, and <em>A Year at the Races</em>, which was published in 1990.<br> <p><strong>Parker</strong>: Joan is an idea person more than a writer. She has done a lot of uncredited thinking for me. But <em>Three Weeks in Spring</em>, about her first bout with breast cancer, was a special case. And <em>A Year at the Races</em>, also nonfiction, was about our initiation into the world of thoroughbred racing. I have found it wise for me to write and Joan to think (egad, what if it were the other way?), but I have also found it wise not to speak for her. I liked working with her. In fact, I like pretty much everything with her.<br><br> <strong>Grafton</strong>: I notice in your bibliography that you wrote a nonfiction book called <em>Parker on Writing</em>. I'd be interested in reading it, but I decided I couldn't afford the $499.99 the book is selling for online. How do you feel about a reprint? (P.S. This is not a sly hint that you should send me a copy....)<br><br> <strong>Parker</strong>: <em>Parker on Writing</em> is a collection of random items loosely about writing that Herb Yellin at Lord John Press collected into a finely manufactured limited edition. Herb is a friend, and given what he paid, I can convincingly say it was affection not money that captured me. I feel fine about a reprint.... If I have an extra I will send you one, but I'll have to look&#x2014;it&#x2019;s quite possible that I don't. <strong><br><br>Grafton</strong>: I'm curious about your experience in writing <em>Chasing the Bear: A Young Spenser Novel</em>. What prompted you to write about Spenser's early life? Did you learn things about him you hadn't known before? <br><strong><br>Parker</strong>: My publisher, agent, and wife all wanted me to try a YA novel. I did three, culminating, at my publisher's request, with <em>Chasing the Bear</em>. Since I knew a great deal about Spenser's adulthood, it was mostly a matter of jacking up the adulthood and sliding a consistent childhood under it. YA novels are hard because you know a great deal that you can't use.<br><strong><br>Grafton</strong>: I saw the movie <em>Appaloosa</em> last night on DVD, and while I haven't had a chance to read the novel and study the two side by side, I got the impression that the movie was close to what you had in mind. Will you write about Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch again? You did seem to leave the door open to that possibility.<br><strong><br>Parker</strong>: I&#x2019;ve written two sequels to <em>Appaloosa</em> (<em>Resolution</em> and <em>Brimstone</em>) and am finishing up a third (<em>Blue-Eyed Devil</em>). Ed Harris did a wonderful job, I thought, with the movie. It is as close as it could possibly be to the book, and those parts that had to be added are hard for me to tell from my own stuff. Harris is genius, as is Viggo [Mortensen]&#x2014;they nailed the characters and the relationship. You can also take Ed Harris's word&#x2014;in your own adventures in Southern California you may have noticed how infrequent that is. Incidentally, Bragg's lawyer in the courtroom scene was played by the great Daniel T. Parker.<br><strong><br>Grafton</strong>: How do you spend your time when you're not writing? Hobbies? Leisure activities? I'm not very good at having fun, but I'm hoping you are. Please advise.<strong><br><br>Parker</strong>: My friend John Marsh once remarked, "I hate fun." I concur. Mostly, I just live my life, which turns out to be fun. I work out, box with a trainer, watch ball games, go out to dinner with Joan. You've met Joan. We&#x2019;ve been married fifty-three years. Now that's fun.<br><br></p>Robert B. Parker was the author of more than fifty books. He died in January 2010.</p><h2>A Clearing In The Distance: Frederick Law Olmsted and America in the 19th Century</h2><p>In a brilliant collaboration between writer and subject, Witold Rybczynski, the bestselling author of <i>Now I Sit Me Down</i><i>,</i> illuminates Frederick Law Olmsted's role as a major cultural figure at the epicenter of nineteenth-century American history.<br><br>We know Olmsted through the physical legacy of his stunning landscapes&#x2014;among them, New York's Central Park, California's Stanford University campus, and Boston's Back Bay Fens. But Olmsted's contemporaries knew a man of even more extraordinarily diverse talents. Born in 1822, he traveled to China on a merchant ship at the age of twenty-one. He cofounded <i>The Nation</i> magazine and was an early voice against slavery. He managed California's largest gold mine and, during the Civil War, served as the executive secretary to the United States Sanitary Commission, the precursor of the Red Cross.<br> <br>Rybczynski's passion for his subject and his understanding of Olmsted's immense complexity and accomplishments make his book a triumphant work. In <i>A Clearing in the Distance,</i> the story of a great nineteenth-century American becomes an intellectual adventure.</p><p>Frederick Law Olmsted (1822-1903) is best remembered today as a landscape designer, well known for his plans for New York's Central Park and Prospect Park, the grounds of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., and the campus of Stanford University, among other noteworthy sites.<p> But, writes urban studies professor and accomplished author Witold Rybczynski, Olmsted was an American original, a 19th-century success story who packed many careers and wide learning and travel into a long life. He spent time in China and Europe, managed a California gold mine, edited <i>The Nation</i>, commanded a medical unit in the Civil War, and crisscrossed the United States many times over, writing long reports and articles all the while. (One series of reports urged, for instance, that the then-remote Yosemite region of California be made a national park.) Olmsted, Rybczynski suggests, changed the face of America: he had a vision of the American landscape as a reflection of the national character, with its broad vistas and open skies, and he was concerned to make America's urban spaces livable, bringing "trees and greenery into the congested grid of streets." At Olmsted's urging, many American and Canadian cities adopted his system of parks, broad avenues, and greenways, which encouraged the appreciation and preservation of nature; his influence is felt today in the so-called urban ecology movement, and in dozens of public spaces across the continent.</p><p> Rybczynski's fine and illuminating biography of Olmsted shows him to have been a man of many parts, an important historical figure whose legacy remains strong nearly a century after his death. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Witold Rybczynski has written about architecture and urbanism for <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Time</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, and <i>The New Yorker</i>. He is the author of the critically acclaimed book <i>Home</i> and the award-winning <i>A Clearing in the Distance</i>, as well as <i>T</i><i>he Biography of a Building</i>, <i>T</i><i>he Mysteries of the Mall</i>, and <i>Now I Sit Me Down</i>. The recipient of the National Building Museum&#x2019;s 2007 Vincent Scully Prize, he lives with his wife in Philadelphia, where he is emeritus professor of architecture at the University of Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p><h2>One Good Earl Deserves a Lover: The Second Rule of Scoundrels (Rules of Scoundrels, 2)</h2><p><p>Lady Philippa Marbury is . . . odd</p><p>The brilliant, bespectacled daughter of a double marquess cares more for books than balls, for science than the season, and for laboratories than love.

I am lord and deity over my books. I tell my heroes to do stuff and they do them, for heaven's sake. But...for some reason, for this book, I wasn't in charge. They were. To be more specific, Pippa was. She wanted her time in Cross's office and she wanted to know what she was missing out on, and she wanted...well...him.

Thompson&#x2019;s life as a rebel&#x2014;from a smart-mouthed Kentucky kid flaunting all authority to a convention-defying journalist who came to personify a wild fusion of fact, fiction, and mind-altering substances.<br><br>Brilliant, provocative, outrageous, and brazen, Hunter S. Thompson's infamous rule breaking&#x2014;in his journalism, in his life, and under the law&#x2014;changed the shape of American letters, and the face of American icons.<br> <br> Call it the evolution of an outlaw. Here are the formative experiences that comprise Thompson&#x2019;s legendary trajectory alongside the weird and the ugly. Whether detailing his exploits as a foreign correspondent in Rio, his job as night manager of the notorious O&#x2019;Farrell Theatre in San Francisco, his epic run for sheriff of Aspen on the Freak Power ticket, or the sensational legal maneuvering that led to his full acquittal in the famous 99 Days trial, Thompson is at the peak of his narrative powers in Kingdom of Fear. And this boisterous, blistering ride illuminates as never before the professional and ideological risk taking of a literary genius and transgressive icon.</p><p><i>Kingdom of Fear</i> is billed as a memoir, but in essence, all of Hunter S. Thompson's books could fit into this category since his life and work have always been tightly bound together by a mythology largely of his own making. (After all, this is the man who, before earning a single dollar as a writer, began meticulously saving a copy of every letter he ever sent.) Still, this is certainly an unconventional memoir, but then what would you expect from the father of gonzo journalism? In these pages Thompson manages to dig deep and reveal a few "loathsome secrets" without offering the kind of personal details he has always avoided. His childhood, for instance, is basically summed up in a sentence: "I look back on my youth with great fondness, but I would not recommend it as a working model to others." He does, however, reflect upon his considerable legacy, including his well-known, and admittedly exaggerated, use of controlled substances ("The brutal reality of politics alone would probably be intolerable without drugs"), as well as offer assessments of his own work, such as <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i> ("It's as good as <i>The Great Gatsby</i> and better than <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>").<p> In this collection of twisted parables and outlaw adventures, Thompson writes about his early run-ins with agents of authority and the lessons learned; his stint in the Air Force and the beginning of his journalism career; his unsuccessful, though illuminating, bid for Sheriff of Aspen, Colorado in 1970 as the Freak Power candidate; the casualties and unintended consequences thus far in the War on Terror; and numerous examples of present-day injustice and hypocrisy--all with his characteristic mix of brutal frankness laced with humor. He also offers his own take on state of the Union: "The prevailing quality of life in America--by <i>any</i> accepted methods of measuring--was inarguably freer and more politically <i>open</i> under Nixon than it is today in this evil year of Our Lord 2002." Thompson continues to make even the most deadly serious subject matter endlessly entertaining. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p>Hunter S. Thompson was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky. His books include <i>Hell's Angels</i>, <i>Fear and Loathing at Rolling Stone</i>, <i>Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72</i>, <i>The Rum Diary</i>, and <i>Better than Sex</i>. He died in February 2005.</p><h2>The Remarkable Record of Job</h2><p><p>Far from being an engaging fable, the account of Job in the bible is one of the most historically and scientifically accurate records of the ancient world. </p><p> Perhaps the oldest book in the Bible, the book of Job touches on many subjects of science and history. This commentary on the controversial Book of Job is very different from most of the seminary and church teachings so prevalent today, for it attests to the historicity of a man named Job who understood at the end of his life that God cannot be &#x201c;figured out,&#x201d; but He can most certainly be trusted.</p></p><p>A prolific and influential scholar known to believers and skeptics alike as &#x201c;the father of modern creation science,&#x201d; Dr. Henry M. Morris truly was a man of science and a staunch man of God. He was even said to have set the terms of debate about evolution for the second half of the 20th century by one Pulitzer Prize-winning academician. Dr. Morris began his serious study of the Bible in the 1930s and authoring books in the 1940s, but it was his landmark work, co-authored with Dr. John Whitcomb, titled <i>The Genesis Flood</i> in 1961 that influenced generations to begin discovering the fallacies of evolution and the biblical truth of creation. <p> With over 60 books, founding and leading the Institute for Creation Research (ICR), Dr. Morris&#x2019; death in 2006 was a profound loss to millions. </p><p> Dr. Morris created a thriving legacy that continues to equip many Christians to be able to defend the accuracy and authority of Scripture today. The new <i>Henry Morris Study Bible</i> and other resources that he developed remain essential sources of knowledge and understanding for believers.</p></p><h2>The Lacemaker</h2><p>When colonial Williamsburg explodes like a powder keg on the eve of the American Revolution, Lady Elisabeth "Liberty" Lawson is abandoned by her fianc� and suspected of being a spy for the hated British. No one comes to her aid save the Patriot Noble Rynallt, a man with formidable enemies of his own. Liberty is left with a terrible choice.

It is the pilgrimatic work of one of the 20th century's greatest theologians. Deeply rooted in tradition, it breaks ground and sows seeds which will bear their fruit in the Second Vatican Council's central documents on the Church. Here, Henri de Lubac, one of the giants of 20th century theology, gathers from throughout the breadth and length of Catholic tradition elements which he synthesizes to show the essentially social and historical character of the Catholic Church and how this worldwide and agelong dimension of the Church is the only adequate matrix for the fulfillment of the person within society and the transcendence of the person towards God. This book is a classic that deserves to be read and reread by every educated Catholic.<br><br></p><p> "For me, the encounter with this book became an essential milestone on my theological journey. For in it de Lubac does not treat merely isolated questions. He makes visible to us in a new way the fundamental intuition of Christian Faith so that from this inner core all the paricular elements appear in a new light."<br><b> Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger/Pope Benedict XVI</b><br><br></p><p> "Few of our living authors have given us a work at once so profound, so apt and so persuasive as this of the great French Jesuit. Certainly, few could have written the book on the basis of such a rich knowledge of the Christian tradition.... De Lubac's thought has the originality which springs from the contact with a great tradition of a brilliant, deep and charitable mind. And it has a contemporaneity that bears witness to a profound, all-embracing, human concern."<br><b>-Dom Christopher Butler</b>, Abbot of Downside <br><br></p><p>"We cannot leave it without referring to its almost incredible comprehensiveness of view.

As the acclaimed author of five memoirs spanning significant turning points in her life, Beth Kephart has been both blessed and bruised by the genre. In <i>Handling the Truth</i>, she thinks out loud about the form&#x2014;on how it gets made, on what it means to make it, on the searing language of truth, on the thin line between remembering and imagining, and, finally, on the rights of memoirists. Drawing on proven writing lessons and classic examples, on the work of her students and on her own memories of weather, landscape, color, and love, Kephart probes the wrenching and essential questions that lie at the heart of memoir. <br><br>A beautifully written work in its own right, <i>Handling the Truth</i> is Kephart&#x2019;s memoir-writing guide for those who read or seek to write the truth.</p><p>Beth Kephart&#x2019;s first memoir was a National Book Award finalist and was named best book of the year (1998) by several publications. Her subsequent four memoirs earned her additional acclaim and standing among memoir readers. A respected reviewer, essayist, and blogger, Kephart chaired juries for both the National Book Awards and the PEN First Nonfiction Awards. A veteran writing teacher, she currently teaches memoir at the University of Pennsylvania.<p>HANDLING <i>the</i> TRUTH</p><p>HANDLING <i>the</i> TRUTH</p><p></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>Throughout the 1990s, I was an unknown and in many ways unschooled writer who was deeply in love with her son. Love, for me, was the time I sat with this boy reading stories. It was the songs I sang to him at night. It was the walks we took and the hats we bought and the important things he taught me about language both received and given, and courage made essential. I wrote love one fragment at a time. I webbed it together until discrete essays became a binding narrative. I sent the manuscript out, a slush-pile writer. When this small book of mine&#x2014;a family book, an intimate book&#x2014;found readers beyond people I personally knew, I was utterly unprepared. I had been an outsider. I had written from the margins. I still had much to learn.</p><p>I would go on to write four more memoirs and a river book that I called <i>Flow</i> that assumed the memoir&#x2019;s form. I would be asked to conduct workshops and give talks&#x2014;in elementary schools, in middle schools, in high schools, at universities, in libraries and community centers. I would write about the writing life for publications great and small. I would chair juries for the National Book Awards and the PEN First Nonfiction Awards and serve on a jury panel for the National Endowment for the Arts. I would explore new genres&#x2014;poetry, fable, young adult literature. I would&#x2014;a brave experiment&#x2014;begin to blog daily in memoiristic fashion. The important thing to me was this: I was still writing. I was still reading. I was still learning.</p><p>When the University of Pennsylvania asked me to teach creative nonfiction, I was not inclined to say yes. Raised up in memoir on my own, surrounded by my own huge but idiosyncratic memoir library, still in many ways making my outsider way into the book world, it wasn&#x2019;t at all clear to me that I would succeed within an Ivy League environment among faculty members who knew what teaching was. I hadn&#x2019;t grown up in the workshop system; how could I teach it? With the exception of three ten-day summer programs I enrolled in when I was already a mother, I had never taken a formal writing class. I was the true memoir autodidact, and this was Penn, where, as a student years before, I had studied the history and sociology of science, swerving clear of English.</p><p>As it turns out, teaching at Penn had been my calling all along. I eased into the responsibility&#x2014;first mentoring a single student, then teaching a select advanced class, then taking on the teaching of Creative Nonfiction 135.302, which has become my favorite job of all. In teaching others memoir, I have taught it to myself&#x2014;the language of expectations and critique, the exemplary work of others, the exercises that yield well-considered work, the morality of the business, the psychic cautions. Teaching memoir is teaching vulnerability is teaching voice is teaching self. Next to motherhood, it has been, for me, the greatest privilege.</p><p>It has also&#x2014;perhaps inevitably&#x2014;led to the writing of this book. <i>Handling the Truth</i> is about the making of memoir, and the consequences. It&#x2019;s about why so many get it wrong, and about how to get it right. It&#x2019;s about the big questions: Is compassion teachable? Do half memories count? Are landscape, weather, color, taste, and music background or foreground? To whom does <i>then</i> belong? And what rights do memoirists have, and how does one transcend particulars to achieve a universal tale, and how does a memoirist feel, once the label is attached, and what <i>is</i> the language of truth? <i>Handling the Truth</i> is about knowing ourselves. It&#x2019;s about writing, word after word, and if it swaggers a little, I hope it teaches a lot, providing a proven framework for teachers, students, and readers.</p><p>ONE</p><p>DEFINITIONS, PRELIMINARIES, CAUTIONS</p><p>PREFATORY</p><p>MAYBE the audacity of it thrills you. Maybe it&#x2019;s always been like this: You out on the edge with your verity serums, your odd-sized heart, your wet eyes, urging. Maybe this is what you are good for, after all, or good <i>at</i>, though there, you&#x2019;ve done it again: wanted proof, suggested the possibility. You teach memoir. You negotiate truth. Goodness doesn&#x2019;t matter here. Bearing witness does.</p><p>Memoir is a strut and a confession, a whisper in the ear, a scream. Memoir performs, then cedes. It is the work of thieves. It is a seduction and a sleight of hand, and the world won&#x2019;t rise above it.</p><p>Or you won&#x2019;t. You in the Victorian manse at the edge of the Ivy League campus, where you arrive early and sit in the attitude of prayer. You who know something not just of the toil but also of the psychic cost, the pummeling doubt, the lacerating regrets that live in the aftermath of public confession. You have written memoir in search of the lessons children teach and in confusion over the entanglements of friendships. You have written in despair regarding the sensational impossibility of knowing another, in defense of the imperiled imagination, and in the throes of the lonesome sink toward middle age. You have written quiet and expected quiet, and yet a terrible noise has hurried in&#x2014;a churlish self-recrimination that cluttered the early hours when clear-minded nonmemoirists slept. You have learned from all that. You have decided. Memoir is, and will still be, but cautions must be taken.</p><p>Teaching memoir is teaching verge. It&#x2019;s teaching questions: Who are you? Where have you been? Where are you going? What do you believe in? What will you fight for? What is the sound of your voice? It&#x2019;s teaching <i>now</i> against <i>then</i>, and leave that out to put this in, and yes, maybe that happened, but what does it <i>mean</i>? An affront? You hope not. A calling? Probably.</p><p>You enter a classroom of students you have never seen before, and over the course of a semester you travel&#x2014;their forgotten paraphernalia in the well of their backpacks, those tattoos on their wrists, those bio notes inked onto the palm of one hand. They will remember their mother&#x2019;s London broil, but not the recipe. They will proffer a profusion of umbrellas and a poor-fitting snowsuit, a pair of polka-dotted boots, red roses at a Pakistani grave, a white billiard ball, a pink-and-orange sari, a box with a secret bottom, Ciao Bella gelato. Someone will make a rat-a-tat out of a remembered list. Someone will walk you through the corridors of the sick or through the staged room of a movie set or beside the big bike that will take them far. Someone will say, <i>Teach me how to write like this</i>, and someone will ask what good writing is, and you will read out loud from the memoirs you have loved, debunk (systematically) and proselytize (effusively), perform Patti Smith and Terrence Des Pres, Geoffrey Wolff and Mark Richard, Marie Arana and Mary Karr, William Fiennes and Michael Ondaatje, C. K. Williams and Natalie Kusz. You will play recordings of Sylvia Plath reciting &#x201c;Lady Lazarus&#x201d; and Etheridge Knight intoning &#x201c;The Idea of Ancestry,&#x201d; and you will say, in a room made dark by encrusted velvet and mahogany stain, <i>You tell me good. You tell me why. Know your opinions and defend them.</i></p><p>These aspiring makers of memoir are who you believe and what you believe in&#x2014;the smiley face tie he wears on Frat Rush Tuesdays, the cheerful interval between her two front teeth, the planks he carries in his dark-blue backpack, the accoutrements of power lifting. Enamored of the color red and hip-hop, declaring you their &#x201c;galentine,&#x201d; impersonating Whitman, missing their mothers, missing their dead, they are, simply and complexly, human, and they may not trust themselves with truth, but they have to trust one another. You insist that they earn the trust of one another.</p><p>And so you will send them out into the world with cameras. And so you will sit them down with songs. And so you will ask them to retrieve what they lost and, after that, to leave aside the merely incidental. You will set a box of cookies on the table, some chocolate-covered berries, some salt-encrusted chips, and then (at last) get out of the way, for every memoir must in the end and on its own emerge and bleed and scab.</p><p><i>Audacity</i> was the wrong word; you see that now. The word, in fact, is <i>privilege</i>. Teaching, after all these years, is the marrow in your bones. Truth is your obsession.</p><p>MEMOIR IS NOT</p><p>HERE are some of the things that memoir is not:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;A chronological, thematically tone-deaf recitation of everything remembered. That&#x2019;s autobiography, which should be left, in this twenty-first century, to politicians and celebrities. Oh, be honest: It should just be left.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;A typeset version of a diary scrawl&#x2014;unfiltered, unshaped. There are remarkable diaries; <i>A Woman in Berlin</i> (anonymous), for example, is artful, heartbreaking, essential. <i>New York Diaries: 1609 to 2009</i> (Teresa Carpenter, editor) is a thrill. But the method of a diarist is to record events and thoughts <i>as they are happening</i>. A memoirist looks back.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Exhibitionism for exhibitionism&#x2019;s sake. If nothing&#x2019;s been learned from a life, is it worth sharing? Or, if nothing&#x2019;s been learned <i>yet</i>, shouldn&#x2019;t the story wait?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;An accusation, a retaliation, a big <i>take that!</i> in type. Fights are waged in bedrooms and courthouses. A memoir is not a fight.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;A lecture, a lesson, a stew of information and facts. Memoirs illuminate and reveal, as opposed to justify and record. They connote and suggest but never insist.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;A self-administered therapy session. Memoirists speak to others and not just to themselves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;An exercise in self-glorification; an ability&#x2014;or refusal&#x2014;to accept one&#x2019;s own culpability; a false allegiance to the idea that a life, any life, can be perfectly lived or faultlessly explained.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;An unwillingness to recognize&#x2014;either explicitly or implicitly&#x2014;that memory is neither machine nor uncontestable. Memory&#x2014;our own and others&#x2019;&#x2014;is a tricky, fallible business.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;A trumped-up, fantastical idea of what an interesting life might have been, <i>if only</i>. A web of lies. A smudge. A mockery of reality. There is a separate (even equal) category for such things. It goes by the name of fiction.<br><p>MEMOIR IS</p><p>IF you want to write memoir, you need to set caterwauling narcissism to the side. You need to soften your stance. You need to work through the explosives&#x2014;anger, aggrandizement, injustice, misfortune, despair, fumes&#x2014;toward mercy. Real memoirists, <i>literary</i> memoirists, don&#x2019;t justify behaviors, decisions, moods. They don&#x2019;t ladder themselves up&#x2014;high, high, high&#x2014;so as to look down upon the rest of us. Real memoirists open themselves to self-discovery and, in the process, make themselves vulnerable&#x2014;not just to the world but also to themselves. They yearn, and they are yearned with. They declare a want to know. They seek out loud. They quest. They lessen the distance. They lean toward.</p><p>Listen, for example, to Michael Ondaatje as he sets out to rediscover&#x2014;and make sense of&#x2014;his Sri Lankan childhood. From the opening pages of <i>Running in the Family</i>:</p><p></p><p>I had already planned the journey back. During quiet afternoons I spread maps onto the floor and searched out possible routes to Ceylon. But it was only in the midst of this party, among my closest friends, that I realized I would be travelling back to the family I had grown from&#x2014;those relations from my parents&#x2019; generation who stood in my memory like frozen opera. I wanted to touch them into words. A perverse and solitary desire. In Jane Austen&#x2019;s <i>Persuasion</i> I had come across the lines, &#x201c;she had been forced into prudence in her youth&#x2014;she learned romance as she grew older&#x2014;the natural sequence of an unnatural beginning.&#x201d; In my mid-thirties I realized I had slipped past a childhood I had ignored and not understood.</p><p></p><p>Diane Keaton, a celebrity who wrote not autobiography but memoir with <i>Then Again</i>, uses collage (letters written, journals plumbed, secrets exposed) to parse a question and to explore (beautifully, calmly, as a human being and not as a star) a thoughtfully articulated theme. It&#x2019;s all here in a single sentence&#x2014;hardly easy gloss. It&#x2019;s the crinkly stuff of living and losing, and it sets the book in motion:</p><p></p><p>Comparing two women with big dreams who shared many of the same conflicts and also happened to be mother and daughter is partially a story of what&#x2019;s lost in success contrasted with what&#x2019;s gained in accepting an ordinary life.</p><p></p><p>Maybe memoir, for some, is the Queen of the Nasties&#x2014;the medical horror story, the impossible loss story, the abuse story, the deprivation story, the I&#x2019;ve-been-cheated story, the headline-making <i>you&#x2019;re kidding me</i>s. But plot (which is to say the stuff of a life) is empty if it doesn&#x2019;t signify, and the unexamined tragedy&#x2014;thank you, Socrates&#x2014;isn&#x2019;t worth the trees it will be inked on or the screen that fingers will smudge. Some of the best memoirs are built not from sensate titillations but from the contemplation of universal questions within a framed perspective.</p><p>Annie Dillard, for example, is not a victim in her growing-up classic, <i>An American Childhood</i>. She&#x2019;s a woman looking back on what it meant to grow awake to the world.</p><p></p><p>I woke in bits, like all children, piecemeal over the years. I discovered myself and the world, and forgot them, and discovered them again. I woke at intervals until, by that September when Father went down the river, the intervals of waking tipped the scales, and I was more often awake than not. I noticed this process of waking, and predicted with terrifying logic that one of these years not far away I would be awake continuously and never slip back, and never be free of myself again.</p><p></p><p>Likewise, while loss frames C. K. Williams&#x2019;s <i>Misgivings</i>, it&#x2019;s not the tragedy he&#x2019;s chasing. It&#x2019;s understanding.</p><p></p><p>My father dead, I come into the room where he lies and I say aloud, immediately concerned that he might still be able to hear me, <i>What a war we had!</i> To my father&#x2019;s body I say it, still propped up on its pillows, before the men from the funeral home arrive to put him into their horrid zippered green bag to take him away, before his night table is cleared of the empty bottles of pills he wolfed down when he&#x2019;d finally been allowed to end the indignity of his suffering, and had found the means to do it.

Read his guest review of <i>The Paris Vendetta</i>:</b> <br> <p> </p><p>I&#x2019;ve known Steve Berry since the beginning of his career. Back in 2002, he approached me to read his first novel, <i>The Amber Room</i>, for a cover blurb. The book&#x2019;s description definitely intrigued me, hinting at a story involving lost treasures, historical mysteries, and characters both compelling and repellant. Still, I turned the first page with a skeptical eye, wondering how a debut author would fare with such a big story. But within a matter of pages, skepticism faded, and awe rose. I read that book in one long sitting and closed the cover and thought: This guy is going to have a huge career. So, of course, I was happy to provide a blurb for that book. By the way, another struggling author was also impressed with the novel and described it as "my kind of thriller--a globe-trotting treasure hunt with exotic locales and ruthless villains." That little-known author was Dan Brown.</p> <p>As years rolled by, my first gut reaction to Steve&#x2019;s writing proved prophetic. His career rocketed after that first book as he produced story after story of nail-biting adventures that spanned the world: from the Russian steppes to the Egyptian desert to the icy caves of Antarctica. He&#x2019;s since become branded as the king of intrigue, a master at folding ancient mysteries into ripped-from-the-headlines adventures. His books have dealt with Vatican prophecies, cures for AIDS, lost ancient libraries, even the discovery of a lost civilization. Over the years, he&#x2019;s gathered a huge international following, climbing bestseller charts around the world.</p> <p>So I picked up his latest book, <i>The Paris Vendetta</i>, and eyed it again with a bit of jaded skepticism. Surely he must have run out of steam. Who could keep producing masterworks of such precise plotting, complicated characters, and heart-pounding adventure year after year? So I settled into my favorite chair and turned the first page of <i>The Paris Vendetta</i>. Within a matter of paragraphs, I was riding with Napoleon through the scorching Egyptian desert, climbing the Great Pyramid for a midnight rendezvous, and discovering something earth-shattering was afoot. But what was it? A few pages later, his main character, the resourceful Cotton Malone, struggles to survive a firefight in his bookstore in Copenhagen. I found myself holding my breath, wincing as the suspense grew as taut as an assassin&#x2019;s garrote, and quickly became embroiled in a conspiracy that trailed back centuries.</p> <p>As I read that book, the hours vanished. Pages continued to fly by. And once again I was hooked. No, more than hooked... I was lost. In the end, that is the true magic and mastery of this man&#x2019;s writing, the true reason he has become the king of intrigue. You don&#x2019;t just read a Steve Berry novel.

"If you were to meet an Englishman in the year 1000," they continue, "the first thing that would strike you would be how tall he was--very much the size of anyone alive today." The Anglo-Saxons were not only tall, but also generally well fed and healthy, more so than many Britons only a few generations ago. Writing in a breezy, often humorous style, Lacey and Danziger draw on the medieval <i>Julius Work Calendar</i>, a document detailing everyday life around A.D. 1000, to reconstruct the spirit and reality of the era. Light though their touch is, they've done their homework, and they take the reader on a well-documented and enjoyable month-by-month tour through a single year, touching on such matters as religious belief, superstition, medicine, cuisine, agriculture, and politics, as well as contemporary ideas of the self and society. Readers should find the authors' discussions of famine and plague a refreshing break from present-day millennial worries, and a very stimulating introduction to medieval English history. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>AS THE SHADOW OF THE MILLENNIUM DESCENDED ACROSS ENGLAND AND CHRISTENDOM, IT SEEMED AS IF THE WORLD WAS ABOUT TO END.

Drawing on archival materials newly released in Russia, he chronicles the upheaval that began as a conservative revolt but was soon captured by messianic intellectuals intent not merely on reforming Russia but on remaking the world. He provides fresh accounts of the revolution&#39;s personalities and policies, crises, and cruelties, from the murder of the royal family through civil war, famine, and state terror. Brilliantly and persuasively, Pipes shows us why the resulting system owes less to the theories of Marx than it did to the character of Lenin and Russia&#39;s long authoritarian tradition.

Married to a man twice her age, quickly widowed, and a mother at only fourteen, Margaret is determined to turn her lonely life into a triumph.

That Richard had them killed either on the day of his coronation, or as he left London.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;And she?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;She was deeply shocked; she could not believe it. But, Lady Margaret, she said a terrible thing . . .&#x2019; He breaks off, as if he dare not name it.<br>&#x2018;Go on,&#x2019; I say but I can feel a cold shiver of dread creeping up my spine. I fear I have been betrayed. I fear that this has gone wrong.<br>&#x2018;She cried out at first and then she said: &#x201c;At least Richard is safe&#x201d;.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;She meant Prince Richard? The younger boy?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;The one they took into the Tower to keep his brother company.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;I know that! But what did she mean?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s what I asked her. I asked her at once what she meant and she smiled at me in the most frightening way and said: &#x201c;Doctor, if you had only two precious, rare jewels and you feared thieves, would you put your two treasures in the same box?&#x201d;&#x2019;<br>He nods at my aghast expression.<br>&#x2018;What does she mean?&#x2019; I repeat.<br>&#x2018;She wouldn&#x2019;t say more. I asked her if Prince Richard was not in the Tower when the two boys were killed? She just said that I was to ask you to put your own guards into the Tower to keep her son safe. She would say nothing more. She sent me away.&#x2019;<br>I rise from my stool. This damned woman, this witch, has been in my light ever since I was a girl, and now, at this very moment when I am using her, using her own adoring family and loyal supporters to wrench the throne from her, to destroy her sons, she may yet win, she may have done something that will spoil everything for me. How does she always do it? How is it that when she is brought so low that I can even bring myself to pray for her, she manages to turn her fortunes around? It must be witchcraft; it can only be witchcraft. Her happiness and her success have haunted my life. I know her to be in league with the devil, for sure. I wish he would take her to hell.<br>&#x2018;You will have to go back to her,&#x2019; I say, turning to him.<br>He almost looks as if he would refuse.<br>&#x2018;What?&#x2019; I snap.<br>&#x2018;Lady Margaret, I swear, I dread going to her. She is like a witch imprisoned in the cleft of a pine tree, she is like an entrapped spirit, she is like a water goddess on a frozen lake, waiting for spring. She lives in the gloom of sanctuary with the river flowing all the time beside their rooms and she listens to the babble as a counsellor. She knows things that she cannot know by earthly means. She fills me with terror. And her daughter is as bad.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;You will have to summon your courage,&#x2019; I say briskly. &#x2018;Be brave, you are doing God&#x2019;s work. You have to go back to her and tell her to be of stout heart. Tell her that I am certain that the princes are alive. Remind her that when we attacked the Tower we heard the guards taking them back from the door. They were alive then, why would Richard kill them now? Richard has taken the throne without killing them, why would he put them to death now? Richard is a man who does his own work and he is hundreds of miles away from them now. Tell her I will double my people in the Tower and that I swear to her, on my honour, that I will protect them. Remind her that the uprising will start next month. As soon as we defeat Richard the king, we will set the boys free. Then, when she is reassured, when she is in her first moment of relief, when you see the colour come to her face and you have convinced her &#x2013; in that moment quickly ask her if she has her son Prince Richard in safety already? If she has him hidden away somewhere?&#x2019;<br>He nods, but he is pale with fear. &#x2018;And are they safe?&#x2019; he asks. &#x2018;Can I truly assure her that those poor boys are safe and we will rescue them? That the rumours, even in your own household, are false? Do you know if they are they alive or dead, Lady Margaret? Can I tell their mother that they are alive and speak the truth?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;They are in the hands of God,&#x2019; I reply steadily. &#x2018;As are we all. My son too. These are dangerous times, and the princes are in the hands of God.&#x2019;<br><br>That night we hear news of the first uprising. It is mistimed, it comes too early. The men of Kent are marching on London, calling on the Duke of Buckingham to take the throne. The county of Sussex gets up in arms, believing they cannot delay a moment longer, and the men of Hampshire beside them rise up too, as a fire will leap from one dry woodland to another. Richard&#x2019;s most loyal commander, Thomas Howard, the brand new Duke of Norfolk, marches down the west road from London, and occupies Guildford, fighting skirmishes to the west and to the east, but holding the rebels down in their own counties, and sending a desperate warning to the king: the counties of the south are up in the name of the former Queen and her imprisoned sons, the princes.<br>Richard, the battle-hardened leader of York, marches south at the fast speed of a York army, makes his centre of command at Lincoln, and raises troops in every county, especially from those who greeted his progress with such joy. He hears of the betrayal of the Duke of Buckingham when men come from Wales to tell him that the duke is already on the march, going north through the Welsh marches, recruiting men and clearly planning to cross at Gloucester, or perhaps Tewkesbury, to come into the heart of England with his own men and his Welsh recruits. His beloved friend, Henry Stafford, is marching out under his standard, as proudly and as bravely as once he did for Richard; only now he is marching against him.<br>Richard goes white with rage and he grips his right arm, his sword arm, above the elbow, as if he were shaking with rage, as if to hold it steady. &#x2018;A man with the best cause to be true,&#x2019; he exclaims. &#x2018;The most untrue creature living. A man who had everything he asked for. Never was a false traitor better treated; a traitor, a traitor.&#x2019;<br>At once he sends out commissions of array to every county in England demanding their loyalty, demanding their arms and their men. This is the first and greatest crisis of his new reign. He summons them to support a York king, he demands the loyalty that they gave to his brother, which they have all promised to him. He warns those who cheered when he took the crown less than sixteen weeks ago that they must now stand by that decision, or England will fall to an unholy alliance of the false Duke of Buckingham, the witch queen, and the Tudor pretender.<br>It is pouring with rain, and there is a strong wind blowing hard from the north. It is unnatural weather, witch&#x2019;s weather. My son must set sail now, if he is to arrive while the queen&#x2019;s supporters are up, and while Buckingham is marching. But if it is so foul here, in the south of England, then I fear the weather in Brittany. He must come at exactly the right moment to catch the weary victor of the first battle and make them turn and fight again, while they are sick of fighting. But &#x2013; I stand at my window and watch the rain pouring down, and the wind lashing the trees in our garden &#x2013; I know he cannot set sail in this weather, the wind is howling towards the south, I cannot believe he will even be able to get out of port.<br><br>The next day the rains are worse and the river is starting to rise. It is over our landing steps at the foot of the garden and the boatmen drag the Stanley barge up the garden to the very orchard, out of the swirling flood, fearing that it will be torn from its moorings by the current. I can&#x2019;t believe that Henry can set sail in this, and even if he were to get out of harbour, I can&#x2019;t believe that he could safely get across the English seas to the south coast. <br>My web of informers, spies and plotters are stunned by the ferocity of the rain, which is like a weapon against us. The roads into London are all but impassable; no-one can get a message through. A horse and rider cannot get from London to Guildford, and as the river rises higher, there is news of flooding and drowning upstream and down. The tides are unnaturally high and every day and night the floods from the river pour down to the inrushing tide and there is a boiling surge of water which wipes out riverside houses, quays, piers and docks. Nobody can remember weather like this, a rain storm which lasts for days, and the rivers are bursting their banks all around England.<br>I have no-one to talk to but my God, and I cannot always hear His voice, as if the rain is blotting out His very face, and the wind blowing away His words. This is how I know for sure that it is a witch&#x2019;s wind. I spend my day at the window overlooking the garden, watching the river boil over the garden wall and come up through the orchard, lap by lap, till the trees themselves seem to be stretching up to the heavy clouds for help. Whenever one of my ladies comes to my side, or Dr Lewis comes to my door, or any of the plotters in London ask for admittance, they all want to know what is happening: as if I know any more than them, when all I can hear is rain, as if I can foretell the future in the galeripped sky. But I know nothing, anything could be happening out there; a waterlogged massacre could be taking place even half a mile away, and none of us would know. We would hear no voices over the sound of the storm, no lights would show through the rain.<br>I spend my nights in my chapel, praying for the safety of my son and the success of our venture, and hearing no answer from God but only the steady hammer of the torrent on the roof and the whine of the wind lifting the slates above me, until I think that God Himself has been blotted from the heavens of England by the witch&#x2019;s wind, and I will never hear Him again.<br>Finally, I get a letter from my husband at Coventry.<br><br><i>The king has commanded my presence and I fear he doubts me. He has sent for my son Lord Strange too, and was very dark when he learned that my son is from his home with an army of ten thousand men on the march, but my son has told nobody where he is going, and his servants only swear that he said he was raising his men for the true cause. I assure the king that my son will be marching to join us, loyal to the throne; but he has not yet arrived here at our command centre, in Coventry Castle.<br>Buckingham is trapped in Wales by the rising of the river Severn. Your son, I believe, will be held in port by the storm on the seas. The queen&#x2019;s men will be unable to march out on the drowned roads and the Duke of Norfolk is waiting for </i><i>them. I think your rebellion is over, you have been beaten by the rain and the rising of the waters. They are calling it the Duke of Buckingham&#x2019;s Water and it has washed him and his ambition to hell along with your hopes. Nobody has seen a storm like this since the Queen Elizabeth called up a mist to hide her husband&#x2019;s army at the battle of Barnet, or summoned snow for him at Tewkesbury. Nobody doubts she can do such a thing and most of us only hope she will stop before she washes us all away. But why? Can she be working against you now? And if so, why? Does she know, with her inner sight, what has befallen her boys and who has done it? Does she think you have done it? Is she drowning your son in revenge?<br>Destroy what papers you have kept, and deny whatever you have done. Richard is coming to London for his revenge and there will be a scaffold built on Tower Green. If he believes half what he has heard he will put you on it and I will be unable to save you.<br>Stanley.<br><br></i>OCTOBER 1483<br><br>I have been on my knees all night, but I don&#x2019;t know if God can hear me through the hellish noise of the rain. My son sets sail from Brittany with fifteen valuable ships and an army of five thousand men and loses them all in the storm at sea. Only two ships struggle ashore on the south coast and learn at once that Buckingham has been defeated by the rising of the river, his rebellion is washed away by the waters, and Richard is waiting, dry-shod, to execute the survivors.<br>My son turns his back on the country that should have been his, and sails for Brittany again, flying like a faintheart, leaving me here, unprotected, and clearly guilty of plotting his rebellion. We are parted once more, my heir and I, this time without even meeting, and this time it feels as if it is for ever. He and Jasper leave me to face the king, who marches vengefully on London like an invading enemy, mad with anger. Dr Lewis vanishes off to Wales, Bishop Morton takes the first ship that can sail after the storms and goes to France, Buckingham&#x2019;s men slip from the City in silence and under lowering skies, the queen&#x2019;s kin make their way to Brittany and to the tattered remains of my son&#x2019;s makeshift court, and my husband arrives in London in the train of King Richard, whose handsome face is dark with the sullen rage of a traitor betrayed. <br>&#x2018;He knows,&#x2019;my husband says shortly as he comes to my room, his travelling cape still around his shoulders, his sympathy scant. &#x2018;He knows you were working with the queen, and he will put you on trial. He has evidence from half a dozen witnesses. Rebels from Devon to East Anglia know your name and have letters from you.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Husband, surely he will not.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;You are clearly guilty of treason and that is punishable by death.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;But if he thinks you are faithful . . .&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;I <i>am </i>faithful,&#x2019; he corrects me. &#x2018;It is not a matter of opinion but of fact. Not what the king thinks &#x2013; but what he can see. When Buckingham rode out, while you were summoning your son to invade England, and paying rebels, while the queen was raising the southern counties, I was at his side, advising him, loaning him money, calling out my own affinity to defend him, faithful as any northerner. He trusts me now as he has never done before. My son raised an army for him.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Your son&#x2019;s army was for me!&#x2019; I interrupt.<br>&#x2018;My son will deny that, I will deny that, we will call you a liar and nobody can prove anything, either way.&#x2019;<br>I pause. &#x2018;Husband, you will intercede for me?&#x2019;<br>He looks at me thoughtfully, as if the answer could be &#x2018;no&#x2019;.<br>&#x2018;Well, it is a consideration, Lady Margaret. My King Richard is bitter, he cannot believe that the Duke of Buckingham, his best friend, his only friend, should betray him. And you? He is astonished at your infidelity. You carried his wife&#x2019;s train at her coronation, you were her friend, you welcomed her to London. He feels you have betrayed him. Unforgiveably. He thinks you as faithless as your kinsman Buckingham; and Buckingham was executed on the spot.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Buckingham is dead?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;They took off his head in Salisbury market place. The king would not even see him. He was too angry with him and he is filled with hate towards you. You said that Queen Anne was welcome to her city, that she had been missed. You bowed the knee to him and wished him well. And then you sent out messages to every disaffected Lancastrian family in the country to tell them the cousins&#x2019; war had come again, and that this time you will win.&#x2019;<br>I grit my teeth. &#x2018;Should I run away? Should I go to Brittany too?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;My dear, how ever would you get there?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;I have my money chest, I have my guard. I could bribe a ship to take me, if I went down to the docks at London now, I could get away. Or Greenwich. Or I could ride to Dover or Southampton . . .&#x2019;<br>He smiles at me and I remember they call him &#x2018;the fox&#x2019; for his ability to survive, to double back, to e...</p><h2>Cranford (Penguin Clothbound Classics)</h2><p>Part of Penguin&#39;s beautiful hardback Clothbound Classics series, designed by the award-winning Coralie Bickford-Smith, these delectable and collectible editions are bound in high-quality colourful, tactile cloth with foil stamped into the design. Gaskell&#39;s best known work is set in a small rural town, inhabited largely by women. This is a community that runs on cooperation and gossip, at the very heart of which are the daughters of the former rector: Miss Deborah Jenkyns and her sister Miss Matty. But domestic peace is constantly threatened in the form of financial disaster, imagined burglaries, tragic accidents, and the reapparance of long-lost relatives.</p><p>Originally published as a magazine serial and then printed in novel form in 1853, Cranford is a playful tour of a peculiar country town. From the stately, stern Miss Jenkyns to the timid Miss Betsy Barker and her flannel-wearing cow, the inhabitants are all acquainted, and all poised to overhear scandal.<p> Elizabeth Gaskell&#x2019;s episodic second novel, sometimes dismissed as nostalgically &#x201c;charming,&#x201d; is now considered by many critics to be her most sophisticated work. The country town of Cranford is home to a group of women, affectionately called &#x201c;Amazons&#x201d; by the narrator, whose seemingly uneventful lives are full of conflicts, failures, and unexpected connections. A rich commentary on Victorian culture by one of its most astute observers, <em>Cranford </em>owes its enduring popularity to the complex pleasures it offers the reader. </p> <p> This Broadview Edition provides an assortment of historical materials to put the novel in context, including Gaskell&#x2019;s letters from the period of the novel&#x2019;s writing, excerpts from texts read by the characters, illustrations from the novel and from contemporary periodicals, and other Victorian writings on industrialization, etiquette, and domestic life. </p></p><h2>Modern Psychopathologies: A Comprehensive Christian Appraisal (Christian Association for Psychological Studies Books)</h2><p><em>Modern Psychopathologies</em> is addressed to students and mental health professionals who want to sort through contemporary secular understandings of psychopathology in relation to a Christian worldview. Written by well-known and respected scholars, this book provides an introduction to a set of disorders along with overviews of current research on etiology, treatment and prevention. Prior chapters explore the classification of disorders in historic pastoral care and contemporary mental health care. The authors explain the biological and sociocultural foundations of mental illness, and reflect on the relation between psychopathology and the Christian understanding of sin. <em>Modern Psychopathologies</em> is a unique and valuable resource for Christians studying psychology and counseling or providing counseling services, pastoral care, Christian healing ministries or spiritual direction. The revised second edition is fully updated according to DSM-5 and ICD-10. The authors have expanded the analysis to include problems associated with trauma, gender, addiction and more. Though fully capable of standing on its own, the book is a useful companion volume to <em>Modern Psychotherapies</em> by Stanton L. Jones and Richard E. Butman.</p><p>Barrett W. McRay is associate professor of Christian formation and ministry at Wheaton College. A licensed clinical psychologist, he is the clinical director at Alliance Clinical Associates in Wheaton, Illinois."This revised edition of <em>Modern Psychopathologies</em> will be a very useful text for courses in diagnosis and psychopathology in Christian institutions as well as an excellent resource for Christian students enrolled in secular schools. I appreciate the care the authors have taken to place contemporary conceptualizations of psychopathology within the historical context of pastoral care and current church ministry, as well as to incorporate discussion of theological concepts such as the role of sin and suffering. Their organization of the material around <em>DSM-5</em> categories will help students better understand this diagnostic system, while their critiques of <em>DSM-5</em> will help enable students to understand both its benefits and limitations." (Heather Davediuk Gingrich, professor of counseling, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"This second edition of <em>Modern Psychopathologies</em> continues to be a substantial contribution to the integration literature, with distinctively Christian perspectives on pastoral care, sin, and psychopathology. I highly recommend this clearly written and comprehensive book as an integrative text for courses on psychopathology as well as on integration." (Siang-Yang Tan, professor of psychology, Fuller Theological Seminary, author of Counseling and Psychotherapy)<br><br>"The second edition of this seminal work includes helpful information regarding diagnostic changes, both large and small, in <em>DSM-5</em>. The authors remain committed to a holistic understanding of human suffering&#x2015;an approach that seeks to stimulate conversations about the complicated connections among the spiritual, psychological, religious, and secular notions of human dysfunction. Especially helpful is their concluding chapter on responsible care in an imperfect system. Students of abnormal psychology and the art of diagnosis will benefit from this useful and readable text." (James R. Beck, senior professor of counseling, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"Integrating faith with science is a significant undertaking in Christian higher education. As one who teaches Introduction to Psychopathology to beginning clinical psychology doctoral students in a faith-based program, I am consistently searching for tools to assist in the process of integration. I was summarily impressed with the first edition of this book, having used it for several years. I am excited to endorse this second edition, which brings the text up to date with current diagnostic organization and nomenclature in the <em>DSM-5</em>. The authors make integration explicit, sharing connections between historical faith traditions, current faith practices and understanding, and the latest scientific evidence from psychopathology. They outline general frameworks for understanding psychopathology from scriptural, pastoral, and scientific lenses. They then move to nuanced exploration of specific groupings of disorders, maintaining this multiple-lens approach. This allows for the reader to consider pathology from various perspectives and begin the process of integration. I have not found a better tool for assisting students with integration around issues of psychopathology. I highly recommend this text." (David M. Cimbora, professor and associate dean of doctoral programs, Rosemead School of Psychology, Biola University)<br><br>"This book provides Christians in the helping professions with a solid scaffolding for integrating Christian doctrine and practice with psychopathology. The authors deal masterfully with the thorny and complex problem of the relationship between sin and psychopathology as well as the related issue of responsibility. This book combines the best and most recent advances in the understanding of psychopathology with the richness of Christian thought on human suffering, helping to create a vision for a Christian response that moves beyond symptom reduction to flourishing. I highly recommend this book to pastors and therapists seeking to more thoughtfully address human brokenness in all its varieties." (M. Elizabeth Lewis Hall, professor of psychology, Rosemead School of Psychology, Biola University)<br><br>"Finally! A comprehensive Christian perspective on abnormal psychology. This book is grounded, insightful, biblical, practical, accessible&#x2015;and long overdue. Everyone interested in exploring psychopathology from a Christian worldview will relish reading this updated edition of the book." (Les Parrott, department of psychology, Seattle Pacific University, author of Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts)<br><br>"Books on psychopathology are a dime a dozen. However, no other volume takes into consideration the centuries-old tradition of the treatment of the mentally ill by priests and pastors as well as carefully thought-out applied theologies relating sin to human frailty. When these considerations are combined with a definitive survey of contemporary theory and research, we have a seminal volume that will be a standard for years to come. I cannot think of a volume that better balances tradition with practice." (H. Newton Malony, MDiv, Ph.D., Senior Professor, Graduate School of Psychology, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Over the past century, the church and the behavioral sciences have sometimes been at odds over the causes and treatments of mental disorders. This work offers a well-reasoned rapprochement that takes seriously the long tradition of pastoral care and counseling within the church as well as the increasing body of knowledge being amassed in the biopsychosocial sciences."

Sanders, PhD, Clinical Psychologist and former Executive Director of Christian Association for Psychological Studies (CAPS))</p><h2>Bountiful, Beautiful, Blissful: Experience the Natural Power of Pregnancy and Birth with Kundalini Yoga and Meditation</h2><p><p>From internationally renowned yoga teacher Gurmukh comes a book on pregnancy unlike any other. <i>Bountiful, Beautiful, Blissful</i> is a treasury of wisdom, information, and inspiration for pregnancy and motherhood based on the spiritual and physical practices of Kundalini yoga, which Gurmukh has taught for the last thirty years. </p><p>With illustrated, step-by-step instructions, she teaches time-tested techniques, meditations, and exercises that will help you physically, mentally, and spiritually.

Pretty much kept up, too, even though he'd been on a fast horse.<br><br>He was dead meat.<br><br>The buggy she drove might have been a chariot, drawn by the four horses of the Apocalypse, instead of a battered conveyance and a single lathered and huffing nag, both hastily procured at the livery stable in town. For the length of a heartbeat, Jeb actually believed she meant to run him down, grind him into a pulp under the wheels of that spindly, black-bonneted rig. For all his reckless love of life, he could not help but conclude that there would have been a certain mercy in oblivion. At least then he wouldn't have had to deal with the problem.<br><br>Clearly, he was not to be spared.<br><br>After a minute or two, his stepmother's chickens settled down a little, though, and went back to their ground-pecking and feather-shuffling. Maybe that was a good omen.<br><br>The only rooster in evidence, Jeb scrambled for his trademark grin, his one talisman, found a shaky semblance of it, and stuck it to his mouth. He put his hands out from his sides and made himself the picture of innocent affability, though on the inside, he was a tangle of contradictory emotions -- sweet terror, bitter amusement, and anger, too, because, <i>dammit,</i> he was right, and she was wrong. And because he had never guessed, before that day, that among his many secret and interchangeable selves lurked a yellow-bellied chicken heart.<br><br>"Chloe," he said, making a plea of the word, as well as a smooth reprimand. A red hen tapped briefly at the toe of his right boot; he ankled it aside impatiently.<br><br>Standing up in the buggy now, drawing back on the reins with powerful, delicate hands, Chloe fixed him in a sapphire glare. "Don't you 'Chloe' <i>me,</i> Jeb McKettrick!" she commanded. "You're a liar and a cheat and three kinds of devil -- you've all but ruined my reputation and my life, you sorry excuse for a man, and I have half a mind to whip the hide off you right here and now!"<br><br>He rolled his shoulders once, within his brown corduroy jacket, pushed his hat to the back of his head. He had no defense, other than his charm and good looks, which did not seem to be having any noticeable effect. "May I suggest," he countered, with an ease that was wholly false, "that you consult the other half?"<br><br>She set the brake lever, snatched up the buggy whip, and clambered down; all of this happened so quickly that the separate motions seemed to tumble into one continuous whole. Her auburn hair, falling from its pins and combs, blazed like fire around her face, which was flushed with outrage, and she advanced. "Scoundrel!" she spat. "Rounder! Do you have any idea what I've been through because of you?"<br><br>"Chloe," he said again, with hopeless goodwill.<br><br>She took his measure with her eyes and plainly found him wanting, but she was a little calmer, it seemed to him. Or maybe she was merely winded by the mad rush from town. By some perverse twist of fate, he'd just come out of the Bloody Basin Saloon when she stepped down from the afternoon stage, and he'd been as surprised to see Chloe Wakefield as she'd been to see him. He'd made up his mind to face her, try to make peace, but when he'd registered the look of shock and indignation on her face, he'd panicked instead, mounted up, and ridden back to the ranch like a mouse bolting for a hole in the wall.<br><br>"If there was any justice in this world, you would have sprouted horns and cloven hooves by now," she burst out. Pink spots pulsed beneath her flawless cheekbones, and her lovely bosom rose and fell with the rapid, shallow rhythm of her breath.<br><br>He waited. It was that or dive into the manure pile and try to bury himself.<br><br>"Did you think I wouldn't find you someday?" she asked, and though her eyes were still snapping with conviction, her tone was softer than before. Was she settling down? He couldn't rightly guess, and didn't want to err on the side of optimism, which was his natural inclination.<br><br>"I guess it never occurred to me that you'd come looking," he replied, in all truth. He'd fled to Tombstone, stung by the discovery that half his father's life had been a lie, and therefore much of his own as well, and facing the probable loss of what he held most dear in all the world -- the Triple M. By decree of the almighty Angus McKettrick, the ranch would go to the first of his three sons to marry and provide the old man with a grandchild, a contest his eldest brother Rafe had all but won by getting hitched to Emmeline. And now Kade was married, too, and still in the running.<br><br>His own prospects had seemed worse than dismal at the time -- who'd have thought they could get worse?<br><br>Back then, Jeb's plan had been to carouse his troubles away, bedding as many dancing girls as possible, playing as much poker as he could, and consuming copious amounts of whiskey. Instead, he'd encountered the lively Miss Wakefield right out of the chute, and things had promptly gotten out of hand. Oh, yes, from the moment he'd collided with Chloe in front of a mercantile in Tombstone, chaos had been the order of the day.<br><br>Hell, he'd have been better off at the OK Corral, siding with the Clantons and McLaurys against Doc Holliday and the Earps. At least then he'd have had a fighting chance.<br><br>Was that the glimmer of tears he saw in her eyes? Please, God, anything but that. For all of it, he'd rather be flayed alive than see her cry.<br><br>"You and I are married," she said. She held up her left hand, his ring glinting in the crisp sunshine of that October afternoon. Fresh color flared in her face. "Or did that slip your mind?"<br><br>He took off his hat, put it on again, this time with the brim drawn down, to cast a shadow over his face. He'd been over this same terrain a dozen times, walking the landscape of his own conscience, raising all the unflattering arguments that could be made against him, and shooting each one down like a tin can tossed against the crisp autumn sky. And none of that had prepared him for this single, inevitable confrontation.<br><br>The manure pile was beginning to look downright inviting.<br><br>"Our getting married was a mistake," he said, in what he hoped was a reasonable tone of voice. For a moment, he was back in Tombstone, a happy bridegroom of less than an hour, with a honeymoon ahead of him, being stopped in the street by a stranger, presented with irrefutable proof that he'd just been crowned king of fools. "It should never have happened in the first place."<br><br>He saw her stiffen at his words, then commence building up a head of steam again. "At last," she said. "Something we can agree on. I should never have given you the time of day!"<br><br>"Go back to Tombstone, Chloe," he said flatly.<br><br>"I can't," she retorted, with an indignant little huff of a sigh. "Thanks to you, and that scene you made in the Broken Stirrup Saloon, I lost my teaching job. I'm a poor moral influence, according to the president of the school board. <i>That's</i> why I followed you out here -- to tell you that <i>you've ruined my life!"</i><br><br>"I might have overreacted a little, back there at the Broken Stirrup, I mean," he allowed, but grudgingly. There was more of the old man in him, he guessed, than he liked to think. He felt Angus McKettrick's pride and stubbornness right there, behind his heart, jostling for standing room next to the coward. Furious with himself for letting Chloe get him on the run in the first place -- so many people in town had seen him run for his horse and bolt that he'd probably never live it down. And that wasn't counting the spectacle he'd made in front of his brothers just minutes before, riding up in a frenzy and yammering at Rafe and Kade to hide him -- God knew what they'd told her, when she'd stopped to speak to them. He took a step toward her, gratified when she took a corresponding step back. "Anyway, we settled all this before I left Tombstone. Far as I'm concerned, you got what you had coming."<br><br>She had the lid-rattling look of a kettle coming to a high boil; he thought the top of her head was fixing to blow right off and braced himself for a steam burn. "You did most of the talking, if you'll remember," she accused. "You never gave me a chance to explain!"<br><br>He wrenched the buggy whip out of her right hand and hurled it aside. If she went after it, she'd find herself up to her pretty little nose in horse shit, literally as well as figuratively. "Once I saw your wedding picture, Miss Wakefield, and the man you were standing beside in that daguerreotype didn't happen to be me, no further explanations were required!"<br><br>Her eyes widened, as though he'd struck her, and her mouth tightened. She took back the scant inches of sod she'd given up moments before, standing toe-to-toe and nose to nose with him. <i>"Please</i> stop trying to portray yourself as the injured party," she snapped. "You didn't mean any of the things you said when we were courting, and you damn well know it, you -- you -- "<br><br>Guilt foamed up inside him, like the head on a mug of just-drawn beer, but he blew it aside. His jaw clamped down so hard that it hurt, and the challenge hissed through his teeth. "Yes?" he prompted.<br><br>She was utterly defiant, a petticoat-Texan, holding the Alamo all on her own. <i>"You used me,"</i> she repeated. "You wanted a wife and a baby, so you could get this ranch!"<br><br>He indulged in an insolent shrug, though he was surprised that she knew about his father's unreasonable demand. "You seemed willing enough to me."<br><br>That was when she drew back her hand and slapped him hard enough to loosen his teeth. Rage sang through him, so pure and so intense that it was almost pleasurable. He gripped her wrists, to forestall another attack, though there wasn't much he could do about her feet. He'd be lucky if she didn't haul off and kick him in the shins with one of those pointy-toed shoes she was wearing.<br><br>"You bastard!" she breathed. "You unconscionable wretch!"<br><br>He tightened his grasp, taking care not to hurt her. "Is that what you came all this way to say?" he shot back. "Well, now you've said it. Get in your hired buggy, Chloe, and go home to your husband!"<br><br>She struggled to free herself, sputtering, too angry to speak coherently. He saw the intention to splinter his bones brewing in her eyes, clear as clouds gathering on a dark horizon, and sidestepped it, still holding her wrists.<br><br>Her eyes shimmered with tears, and she made no attempt to hide them. "I would dearly love to kill you right now," she informed him, and he knew she meant it. "Jack Barrett <i>is not</i> my husband -- you are!"<br><br>"What the devil is going on here?"<br><br>At the intrusion of an all-too-familiar voice, Jeb turned his head, as did Chloe, and saw his pa standing a few feet away, hoary thumbs hooked under his belt. Angus McKettrick was a big man, well over six feet tall, rugged as the Texas plains that had spawned him, and just then, he looked stern enough to have stepped right out of the pages of the Old Testament.<br><br>Riled and chagrined, both at the same time, Jeb let go of Chloe with a flinging motion of his hands, not at all sure she wouldn't take advantage of the distraction to kick him where it would hurt most, which sure as hell wasn't his shins. He knew he ought to answer his father's terse if perfectly sensible question, but he couldn't think of a single sane explanation. When he and Chloe were together, they either fought like wildcats or made love like monkeys, and there didn't seem to be much middle ground between the two extremes.<br><br>Chloe visibly smoothed her disgruntled countenance, favored the meddlesome old coot with a wistful smile, and put out a hand, stepping toward Angus as cordially as if they'd met at a garden party instead of out behind the bunkhouse, next to the manure pile, surrounded by chickens. "How do you do?" she said brightly. "My name is Chloe McKettrick. I'm Jeb's wife."<br><br>Angus looked baffled for a moment, but then a beatific smile spread across his face. He took the hand she offered and squeezed it warmly. "Well, now," the big man said, "my youngest here has been claiming he'd taken himself a bride, but I confess I was doubtful, since I never saw any sign of you." After tossing Jeb a look that would sear the hide off a bear, he beamed at Chloe. "I'm Angus McKettrick, the head of this outfit. Come on inside. The family will be pleased to make your acquaintance at long last."<br><br>Jeb tried to intercede. "Pa -- " Sure, he'd let his father and brothers believe he was married, mostly to nettle them, to shake Kade's and Rafe's confidence a little, since they'd been so all-fired sure that one or the other of them would win control of the Triple M, leaving him out in the cold, but it had all been so much smoke and bullshit. Chloe was another man's wife, whatever her protests to the contrary, and that was the stark reality. "Pa, listen to me, I -- she -- "<br><br>Angus pointed a work-gnarled index finger in his direction. "Not another word," he warned, all glower, grit, and gravel.<br><br>Jeb seethed with indignation, but at the moment it didn't seem prudent to state his case. Besides, it meant saying straight out that he'd been bamboozled but good, and such an admission would have stuck in his throat like a wadded-up sock.<br><br>A regular ladies' man, Angus crooked his elbow at Chloe, and she swept right around and linked her arm with his, leaving Jeb behind as surely as if he'd turned invisible. The two of them strolled off in the direction of the house, and neither one so much as flinched when Jeb threw back his head, about to split open in frustration, and gave a Rebel yell fit to rend the heavens.<br><br>It sure scared the chickens, though.<br><br>Copyright � 2004 by Linda Lael Miller</p><h2>A Goddess Among Us: The Divine Life Of Anandamayi Ma</h2><p>&#x201c;It cannot be that anybody, anywhere is not my very own. I am with you at all times.&#x201d; Clothed in spotless white... the image of simplicity and gentleness, Anandamayi Ma was one of the most influential spiritual teachers of our time. Her devotees ranged from prime ministers to renowned saints to humble villagers. Although virtually uneducated, Ma spoke with the authority of direct experience and mesmerised all with her ethereal beauty, sweetness and grace. A free spirit, she wandered all over the country showering her love and tender care on everyone. Across India, several ashrams, established and dedicated in her name, today serve as sanctuaries for spiritual seekers. Wherever she went, miracles followed in her wake. From suddenly appearing at the bedside of a dying woman... to breathing life into an ant crushed thoughtlessly underfoot, everything was manifested effortlessly and graciously through Ma. Her samadhi at Kankhal near Haridwar, radiates peace and showers blessings on devotees who come to pay their respects from all over the world. This short biography, written by a "dikshit" &#x2013; a direct disciple of Ma, seeks to acquaint you with the sacred persona, inspired wisdom and the divine life of Anandamayi Ma. Its highlight is a chapter on new incidents that have come to light and never before been published in any biography of Ma.</p><p>Anandamayi Ma was born in East Bengal (now Bangladesh) in 1896. Her father, Bipin Behari Bhattacarya, sang Vaisnava songs often appearing to be intoxicated. He would rise at 3 AM and sing songs, and was given to wandering for long periods. His wife would go searching for him and bring him back home. On one occasion, during a storm, the roof blew off the house and he continued singing in the rain.Anandamayi was a holy woman without formal religious training or initiation whose status was based entirely on her ecstatic states. She did not have an outer guru, though she did hear voices that told her what religious and meditative practices to perform. She emphasized the importance of detachment from the world and religious devotion. She also encouraged her devotees to serve others. She did much traveling and wandering, at times refusing to stay at the ashrams her devotees provided for her. While her parents worshiped Krishna, she could not be placed in any definite tradition. An ecstatic child of ecstatic parents, she became a famous saint who like many other female Indian saints stood on the edge of several religious traditions, and in the midst of none. She influenced the spirituality of thousands of people who came to see her throughout her long life, and died in 1981.How beautifully the author has captured the Divine Life of Anadamayi Ma! Must read for spiritual seekers. --By Pradeep Kumar on 27 October 2015<br><br>This book gives a summary of Maa's life. I did contact the author, and he is such a wonderful person.

People heard demon and they conjured up all kinds of Hieronymus Bosch helter-skelter&#x2014;or worse, Dante&#x2019;s stupid-ass Inferno crap. Honestly. Flames and tortured souls and everyone wailing.</p><p>Okay, maybe Hell was a little toasty. And if the place had had a court painter, Bosch would have been at the head of the pack.</p><p>But that wasn&#x2019;t the point. The Demon actually saw itself as more of a Free-Will Coach. Much better, more modern. The anti-Oprah, as it were.</p><p>It was all about influence.</p><p>The thing was, the qualities of the soul were not dissimilar to the components of the human body. The corporeal form had a number of vestigial parts, like the appendix, the wisdom teeth, and the coccyx&#x2014;all of which were at best unnecessary, and at worst capable of compromising the functioning of the whole.</p><p>Souls were the same. They, too, had useless baggage that impeded their proper performance, these annoying, holier-than-thou bits dangling like an appendix waiting for infection. Faith and hope and love...prudence, temperance, justice, and fortitude...all this useless clutter just packed too much damn morality into the heart, getting in the way of the soul&#x2019;s innate desire for malignancy.</p><p>A demon&#x2019;s role was to help people see and express their inner truth without their being clouded by all that bullshit, diverting humanity. As long as people stayed true to their core, things were going in the right direction.</p><p>And lately, that had been relatively true. Between all the wars on the planet, and the crime, and the disregard for the environment, and that cesspool of finance known as Wall Street, as well as the inequalities far and wide, things were okay.</p><p>But it wasn&#x2019;t enough and time was running out.</p><p>To go with a sports analogy, Earth was the playing field and the game had been going on since the stadium had been built. The Demons were the Home Team. Away was made up of Angels pimping that chimera of happiness, Heaven.</p><p>Where the court painter was Thomas Kincaid, for fuck&#x2019;s sake.</p><p>Each soul was a quarterback on the field, a participant in the universal struggle of good against evil, and the scoreboard reflected the relative moral value of his or her deeds on earth. Birth was kickoff and death was game-over&#x2014;whereupon the score would be added to the larger tally. Coaches had to stay on the sidelines, but they could put different complements of players on the field with the human to influence things&#x2014;and also call time-outs for pep talks.</p><p>Commonly known as the &#x201c;near-death experience.&#x201d;</p><p>Here was the problem: Like a spectator who had been watching a postseason game in a cold seat with one too many hot dogs in his belly and a screamer sitting right behind his ear, the Creator was eyeing the exit.</p><p>Too many fumbles. Too many time-outs. Too many ties that had led to too many unresolved overtimes. What had started out as a gripping contest had evidently lost its appeal, and the teams had been given their notice: Wrap up the play, boys.</p><p>So both sides had to agree on one particular quarterback. One quarterback and seven plays.</p><p>Instead of an endless parade of humans, they were down to seven souls in the balance between good and evil...seven chances to determine whether humanity was good or bad. A tie was not possible and the stakes were...everything. If Team Demon won, it got to keep the facility and all the players that had ever been or ever would be. And the Angels became slaves for eternity.</p><p>Which made torturing human sinners seem like nothing but a bore.</p><p>If the Angels won, the entire Earth would be nothing but one giant Christmas frickin&#x2019; morning, a choking wave of happiness and warmth and caring and sharing taking over everything. Under that hideous scenario, the Demons would cease to exist not just in the universe, but in the hearts and minds of all of humanity.</p><p>Although considering all the happy-happy, joy-joy, that was the best outcome in that scenario. Short of getting stabbed repeatedly in the eye with a pole.</p><p>The Demons couldn&#x2019;t bear losing. It just wasn&#x2019;t an option. Seven chances were not a lot, and the Away Team had won the metaphysical coin toss&#x2014;so they got to approach the quarterback who was going to drive the seven &#x201c;balls,&#x201d; as it were.</p><p>Ah, yes...the quarterback. Not surprisingly the choice of that key position had led to a lot of heated discussion.

Across the crowded, dim club, past bodies that were clad in black and hung with chains, through the thick air of sex and desperation, he saw the &#x201c;she&#x201d; in question.</p><p>A woman in a blue dress stood beneath one of the few ceiling lights in the Iron Mask, the golden glow floating down over her Brooke Shields brown hair and her ivory skin and her banging body. She was a revelation, a standout slice of color among all the gloomy, neo-Victorian Prozac candidates, as beautiful as a model, as resplendent as a saint.</p><p>And she was staring at him, though he questioned the wanting part: Her eyes were set deep, which meant as she looked over, the yearning that stalled out his lungs could just be a product of the way her skull was built.</p><p>Hell, maybe she was simply wondering what he was doing in the club. Which made two of them.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling you, that woman wants you, buddy.&#x201d;</p><p>Jim glanced over at Mr. Matchmaker. Adrian Vogel was the reason he&#x2019;d ended up here, and the Iron Mask was definitely the guy&#x2019;s scene: Ad was dressed in black from head to toe and had piercings in places most people didn&#x2019;t want needles anywhere around.</p><p>&#x201c;Nah.&#x201d; Jim took another swig of his Bud. &#x201c;Not her type.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You sure about that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yup.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a fool.&#x201d; Adrian dragged a hand through the black waves on his head and the stuff eased back into place like it had been trained well. Christ, if it weren&#x2019;t for the fact that he worked construction and had a mouth like a sailor, you&#x2019;d wonder whether he trolled the women&#x2019;s mousse and spray aisles.</p><p>Eddie Blackhawk, the other guy with them, shook his head. &#x201c;If he&#x2019;s not interested, that doesn&#x2019;t make him foolish.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Says you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Live and let live, Adrian. It&#x2019;s better for everyone.&#x201d;</p><p>As the guy eased back on the velvet couch, Eddie was more Biker than Goth in his jeans and shitkickers, so he looked as out of place as Jim did&#x2014;although given the hulking size of the guy and those weird-ass red-brown eyes of his, it was hard to imagine him fitting in with anyone but a bunch of pro wrestlers: even with his hair in that long braid, nobody razzed him at the construction site&#x2014;not even the meathead roofers who gave the biggest lip.</p><p>&#x201c;So, Jim, you don&#x2019;t talk much.&#x201d; Adrian scanned the crowd, no doubt looking for a Blue Dress of his own. After focusing on the dancers who writhed in iron cages, he flagged their waitress. &#x201c;And after working with you for a month, I know it&#x2019;s not because you&#x2019;re stupid.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t have a lot to say.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing wrong with that,&#x201d; Eddie murmured.</p><p>This was probably why Jim liked Eddie better. The SOB was another member of the Spare Club for Men, a guy who never used a word when a nod or a shake of the head could get his point across. How he&#x2019;d gotten so tight with Adrian, whose mouth had no neutral on its stick shift, was a mystery.</p><p>How he roomed with the fucker was inexplicable.</p><p>Whatever. Jim had no intention of going into all their hows, whys and wheres. It was nothing personal. They were actually the kind of hardheaded smart-asses he would have been friends with in another time, on another planet, but here and now, their shit was none of his business&#x2014;and he&#x2019;d only gone out with them because Adrian had threatened to keep asking until he did.</p><p>Bottom line, Jim lived life by the code of the disconnected and expected other people to leave him to his I-am-an-island routine. Since getting out of the military, he&#x2019;d been vagabonding it, ending up in Caldwell only because it was where he&#x2019;d stopped driving&#x2014;and he was going to hit the road after the project they were all working on was finished.</p><p>The thing was, given his old boss, it was better to stay a moving target. No telling how long it was going to be before a &#x201c;special assignment&#x201d; popped up and Jim got tagged again.</p><p>Finishing off his beer, he figured it was a good thing he owned only his clothes, his truck, and that broken-down Harley. Sure, he didn&#x2019;t have much to show for being thirty-nine&#x2014;</p><p>Oh, man...the date.</p><p>He was forty. Tonight was his birthday.</p><p>&#x201c;So I gotta know,&#x201d; Adrian said, leaning in. &#x201c;You have a woman, Jim? That why you&#x2019;re not picking up Blue Dress? I mean, come on, she&#x2019;s smokin&#x2019; hot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Looks aren&#x2019;t everything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, well, they sure as hell don&#x2019;t hurt.&#x201d;</p><p>The waitress came over, and while the others ordered another round, Jim shot a glance at the woman they were jawing about.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t look away. Didn&#x2019;t flinch. Just slowly licked her red lips like she&#x2019;d been waiting for him to make eye contact again.</p><p>Jim refocused on his empty Bud and shifted in the booth, feeling like someone had slipped lit coals into his...</p></p><h2>Respect!: Consent, Boundaries and Being in Charge of YOU</h2><p><p><b></b><br><b>Be the ruler of your own body!</b></p><p>Your body belongs to you and you get to set your own rules.

City officials are rediscovering it as a multi-pronged (or -spoked) solution to acute, 21st-century problems, including affordability, obesity, congestion, climate change, inequity, and social isolation. As the world&#x2019;s foremost cycling nation, the Netherlands is the only country where the number of bikes exceeds the number of people, primarily because the Dutch have built a cycling culture accessible to everyone, regardless of age, ability, or economic means.<br><br> Chris and Melissa Bruntlett share the incredible success of the Netherlands through engaging interviews with local experts and stories of their own delightful experiences riding in five Dutch cities. <i>Building the Cycling City</i> examines the triumphs and challenges of the Dutch while also presenting stories of North American cities already implementing lessons from across the Atlantic. Discover how Dutch cities inspired Atlanta to look at its transit-bike connection in a new way and showed Seattle how to teach its residents to realize the freedom of biking, along with other encouraging examples.<br><br> Tellingly, the Dutch have two words for people who ride bikes: <i>wielrenner </i>(&#x201c;wheel runner&#x201d;) and <i>fietser </i>(&#x201c;cyclist&#x201d;), the latter making up the vast majority of people pedaling on their streets, and representing a far more accessible, casual, and inclusive style of urban cycling&#x2014;walking with wheels. Outside of their borders, a significant cultural shift is needed to seamlessly integrate the bicycle into everyday life and create a whole world of <i>fietsers</i>. The Dutch blueprint focuses on how people in a particular place <i>want </i>to move.<br><br> The relatable success stories will leave readers inspired and ready to adopt and implement approaches to make their own cities better places to live, work, play, and&#x2014;of course&#x2014;cycle.</p><p>Chris and Melissa Bruntlett are co-founders of a marketing and communications firm focused on inspiring healthier, happier, simpler forms of mobility through words, photography, and film.

Craft brewers and homebrewers have adapted traditional European techniques to create some of the world&#x2019;s most distinctive and experimental styles. This book details the wide array of processes and ingredients in American sour beer production, with actionable advice for each stage of the process. Inspiration, education and practical applications for brewers of all levels are provided by some of the country&#x2019;s best known sour beer brewers.<br></p><p>Michael Tonsmeire is an award-winning homebrewer, certified beer judge, sour beer blogger and has written articles on sour beers for various beer magazines.

Each spring, American shad-Alosa sapidissima-leave the ocean in hundreds of thousands and run heroic distances upriver to spawn. </p><p>McPhee--a shad fisherman himself--recounts the shad's cameo role in the lives of George Washington and Henry David Thoreau. He fishes with and visits the laboratories of famous ichthyologists; he takes instruction in the making of shad darts from a master of the art; and he cooks shad in a variety of ways, delectably explained at the end of the book. Mostly, though, he goes fishing for shad in various North American rivers, and he "fishes the same way he writes books, avidly and intensely. He wants to know everything about the fish he's after--its history, its habits, its place in the cosmos" (Bill Pride, <i>The Denver Post</i>). His adventures in pursuit of shad occasion the kind of writing--expert and ardent--at which he has no equal.</p></p><p><p><b>John McPhee</b> was born in Princeton, New Jersey, and was educated at Princeton University and Cambridge University.

He lives in Princeton, New Jersey.</p><b>They're in the River</b><br>I hadn't been a shad fisherman all my days, only seven years, on the May evening when this story begins -- in a johnboat, flat and square, anchored in heavy current by the bridge in Lambertville, on the wall of the eddy below the fourth pier. I say Lambertville (New Jersey) because that's where we launch, but the Delaware River is more than a thousand feet wide there, and, counting west- ward, the fourth of the five stone bridge piers is close to New Hope, Pennsylvania. Yet it rises from the channel where the river is deepest. <br>American shad are schooling ocean fish, and when they come in to make their run up the river they follow the deep channels. In the estuary toward the end of winter, they mill around in tremendous numbers, waiting for the temperature in the cold river current to rise. When it warms past forty Fahrenheit, they begin their migration, in pulses, pods -- males (for the most part) first. Soon, a single sentence moves northward with them -- in e-mails, on telephones, down hallways, up streets -- sending amps and volts through the likes of me. The phone rings, and someone says, "They're in the river." No two shad fishermen agree on much of anything, but I would say that if a female takes your lure you know it from the first moments, or think you do, and you're not often wrong. If you have a male on, you may be at first uncertain. but then he displays his character and you know it's a buck shad. The roe shad is often twice the size of the buck shad. She may weigh five to six pounds, while he weighs two or three. Shad don't exactly strike. First there's a fixed moment -- a second or two in which you feel what appears to be a snag (and might be); then the bottom of the river seems to move, as if you are tied to a working trampoline; and you start thinking five, six pounds, big fillets in the broiler, the grained savor of lemoned roe; but now this little buck shad -- two and a half pounds -- takes off across the river, flies into the air, and struts around on his tail. He leaps again. He leaps once more and does a complete somersault. He can't be said to be cocky, of course, but he suggests cockiness and pretension. He's all show and no roe. She doesn't move. Her size and weight are not at first especially employed. Yet here is the message she sends up the line: If this isn't bedrock you'd be better off if it were; if you're in a hurry, get out your scissors. She stays low, and holds; and soon you are sure about the weight and the sex. Now, straight across the river and away, deep, she strips line, your reel drag clicking. She turns and moves back, an arcuate run. You're supposed to keep things taut but often she'll do it for you. When, rising, she rolls near the surface, she looks even larger than she is. She, too, can leap, can do a front flip, but she obviously knows that her shrewdest position is broadside to full current. It's as difficult to move her as it would be to reel in a boat sideways. <br>Like salmon, shad return to their natal rivers and eat nothing on the spawning run. Lake salmon swimming two thousand miles up the Yukon River, migrating shad exist on their own fat. So why do shad and salmon respond to lures? Up and down the river, almost everybody has an answer to that fundamental question, but no one -- bartender or biologist -- really knows. A plurality will tell you that the fish are expressing irritation. Flutter something colorful in their faces and shad will either ignore it completely or snap at it like pit bulls. More precisely, they'll swing their heads, as swordfish do, to bat an irritant aside. They don't swallow, since they're not eating. Essentially never does a hook reach the gills, or even much inside the mouth. You hook them in the mouth's outer rim -- in the premaxillary and maxillary bones and sometimes in the ethmoid region at the tip of the snout, all of which are segments of the large open scoop that plows through plankton at sea. <br>Below the Lambertville-New Hope bridge that evening, I was using a shad dart of my own malting. A small metallic cone, it trailed bucktail tied on in a vise. Its body was chartreuse. Its base was dark green. It was coated with clear gloss. Extending with the bucktail from the tip of the cone, its No. 2 hook was black and chemically sharpened. Because the hook shaft includes a right angle and the eye emerges from the side of the cone, a shad dart is hydrodynamically hapless. It flips and flops and buzzes around like a fly that needs killing. If it snags, you're likely to lose it. Snags happen often. Held in the water column by the driving current, my dart was out about seventy feet. Three of us were in the boat, close and tandem. I was in the middle, fishing over the shoulder of the skipper, Ed Cervone. Fishing over my shoulder was Ed's son, Edmund Cervone. Each of them had caught several shad, varying in sex, notable in size. I had caught two roe shad. The sun was setting. It was seven-thirty. Quitting time was upon us, but the rod in my hand was suddenly pulled by a great deal more than the current. The Cervones reeled in their darts and stowed their rods. They would wait and watch, as people do when someone else in a boat has a fish on the line. It felt heavy. It maintained for some time a severe tug without much lateral movement. "Female," I said. "Six pounds." Cervone the Elder, who has a doctorate in psychology, seemed unimpressed -- seemed to be suggesting, through a light shrug, that he knew bullshit by its cover. He knew he wasn't fishing with Buddy Grucela. He knew he wasn't fishing with Erwin Dietz or Gerald Hartzel -- living figures in the Cooperstown of shad. He knew that in my seven years as a shad fisherman I had risen steadily into a zone of terminal mediocrity. And he was well equipped to empathize. Ours was one of twelve boats below and around the western bridge piers. Nearly all the others had been doing well, too. When that fish of mine came on the line toward the end of the day, a guy in the boat next to us looked over and said, "It doesn't get any better than this, does it?" At that moment, thirty feet of line came off the reel against the drag. I thought the line would snap. <br>Dietz and Hartzel are waders, bank fishermen, and you'd usually encounter them far upriver -- at least three hundred miles above the sea buoy -- where the Delaware is narrow, is punctuated with riffles and rapids, and has cut a deep gorge in the Pocono-Catskill plateau. The night air, cooler than the water, makes a thick early mist there. If you wanted to fish near a monumental figure like Dietz, and possibly be there ahead of him, you had to be on the river before dawn. As the light came up, it revealed a dark silhouette in the drifting vapors, standing on a rock catching fish. He always knew how many. "How many is that?" "Eleven." I could fish near him until the sun was high, doing everything he did, and catch nothing, or one or two. Nearing retirement, he was a mason then, in New York City construction. He lived in Queens. Somewhere in my fishing diaries I wrote: "He recovers his dart and casts anew faster than anyone I've ever seen. He brings fish in rapidly, and swiftly releases them. Then his dart is in the air. He is very sensitive on the jig, his rod tip high, his twitch minimal. While I am fishless, Dietz's rod is electric with excitement. Two. Three. Four. He works fish. I watch. And watch. He loses a dart to a snag. Cool. He is idle. Out of it. I am casting -- two, three, four. The numbers refer to casts but not to shad. At last he finishes tying on a new dart, and he flings it into the river. It swings through the current, and his rod is bent by another fish. How . . . Does . . . He . . . Do . . . It? After he casts, he holds his rod at a forty-five-degree angle. His wrist flicks almost imperceptibly at a consistent rate of about once a second. He says he can feel the shad bump the dart in the center of the current, bump it again, and then go for it. His line and his lures are identical with mine. I imitate him as precisely as I can. He hooks fish, I hook water." As Gerald Hartzel stepped into the upper river at five-thirty of a June morning -- after driving more than three hours -- his shad net would be bolstered on his back so that its hoop rose above his head like a circular antenna. He reached for it often. He used a five-and-a-half-foot rod with four-pound line and an ultra-light reel. He had a long wooden staff that floated on a tether beside him. He was slim. Six feet. Polaroid glasses. On his brown hat were two fishing licenses. Sewn on both his hat and his vest was the orange-and-green emblem of the Delaware River Shad Fishermen's Association. He cast with a short direct punch from eye level, as if he were throwing a dart not so much at a fish as at a tavern wall. As one such morning began, he caught a shad, and then another, but not rapidly, and he seemed puzzled. Then, arms up, he began to hold the rod high before him, as if he were reaching for a shelf, and, in quick succession, he flipped up the tip, up again, up once more -- fish on the line. Rooted in fast water, apparently tireless, he caught shad after shad after shad, always with his arms extended high. His darts were very small. Across the morning, they were in the water an amazing percentage of the total time. He was efficient in the rhythm of his casts. Page 1, line 1: If your dart is not in the water you are not catching fish. Jigging -- twitching -- the line, he gave complete attention to each moment of every swing, his eyes swinging, too, like a long-bah hitter's. After fishing downstream from him, I quit when he did. In four and a half hours, I had caught six shad, including one roe that I kept. In the four and a half hours, he had landed twenty-one shad. Wearily rubbing a shoulder, he said, "Did you see what I had to do?" <br>Copyright � 2002 John McPhee</p><h2>Life Lessons from the Princess and the Kiss (Revive Our Hearts)</h2><p>This easty-to-use deovtional companion to The Princess and the Kiss Storybook covers biblical teaching on purity, relationships, and God&#39;s plans for marriage.

No other author has ever been so German and so Jewish or so ambivalent and ironic about being both; Heine would leave an indelible mark on German culture. During these university days, he wore velvet jackets, dandyish Byronic collars, and a fashionable wide-rimmed felt hat known as a Bolivar. Older by two or three years than most of his peers, he was allergic to the alcohol, nicotine, and "patriotic" politics they indulged in so boisterously. His distaste for alcohol persisted; he is said to have claimed that the Jewish contribution to the new German patriotism was "the small glass" of beer.<br></p><h2>It Worked for Me: In Life and Leadership</h2><p><p>Colin Powell, one of America&#x2019;s most admired public figures, reveals the principles that have shaped his life and career in this inspiring and engrossing memoir.</p><p>A beautiful companion to his previous memoir, the #1 <em>New York Times </em>bestseller <em>My American Journey</em>, Powell&#x2019;s <em>It Worked for Me: In Life and Leadership </em>is a trove of wisdom for anyone hoping to achieve their goals and turn their dreams into reality.</p><p>A message of strength and endurance from a man who has dedicated his life to public service, <em>It Worked for Me </em>is a book with the power to show readers everywhere how to achieve a more fulfilling life and career.</p></p><p>A Note from Colin Powell on It Worked for Me <p>I love stories. In the course of my career I gathered a number of them that mean a lot to me. Most come from my military life. I was in the military from age seventeen as an ROTC cadet until I was a retired GI at age fifty-six. Others came from my service as Secretary of State and as National Security Advisor. Yet others came to me as I wandered through life. In this book I want to share with you a selection of these stories as well as experiences that have stayed with me over the years. Each one of them taught me something important about life and leadership. Some of the stories deal with serious aspects of my life, including some of the controversial issues I was involved in during my tenure as Secretary of State. There are also humorous stories from my life as well. I offer them to you for whatever use you may wish to make of them. </p> <p>The first part of It Worked for Me explains my Thirteen Rules, which have been bouncing around since they were first published in Magazine over twenty years ago. These are rules that I have gathered over the years and to which I&#x2019;ve adhered in my career. </p> <p><b>CLP's Thirteen Rules:</b></p> <li>It ain't as bad as you think. It will look better in the morning.</li> <li>Get mad, then get over it.</li> <li>Avoid having your ego so close to your position that when your position falls, your ego goes with it.</li> <li>It can be done!</li> <li>Be careful what you choose. You may get it.</li> <li>Don't let adverse facts stand in the way of a good decision.</li> <li>You can't make someone else's choices. You shouldn't let someone else make yours.</li> <li>Check small things.</li> <li>Share credit.</li> <li>Remain calm. Be kind.</li> <li>Have a vision. Be demanding.</li> <li>Don't take counsel of your fears or naysayers.</li> <li>Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier.</li> <p>The rest of the book focuses on everything from the importance of really knowing who you are and how to always be yourself to why I put an emphasis on knowing and taking care of others, especially those who are your followers. I go into my experience in the exploding digital realm that has reshaped the world and our lives. I talk about how to be a great manager and a great leader. I give no conclusions or recommendations, just my observations. The chapters are free-standing. You can read them straight through or jump in anywhere. Everyone has life lessons and stories. These are mine. All I can say is that they worked for me. --Colin Powell </p><p><em>It Worked for Me</em> is filled with vivid experiences and lessons learned that have shaped the legendary career of the four-star general and former Secretary of State Colin Powell. At its heart are Powell's "Thirteen Rules"&#x2014;notes he gathered over the years and that now form the basis of his leadership presentations. Powell's short but sweet rules such as "Get mad, then get over it" and "Share credit" illustrate his emphasis on conviction, hard work, and, above all, respect for others.</p><p>A natural storyteller, Powell offers warm and engaging parables on succeeding in the workplace and beyond. Taken together, they comprise a powerful portrait of a reflective, self-effacing leader.</p><p>Thoughtful and revealing, Colin Powell's <em>It Worked for Me</em> is a brilliant and original blueprint for leadership.</p></p><h2>The Wisdom of Not Knowing: Discovering a Life of Wonder by Embracing Uncertainty</h2><p><strong>A deeply affirming exploration of the challenges and possibilities of the unknown--with meditations and exercises that can help transform the fear and uncertainty of "not knowing" into a sense of openness, curiosity, and bravery.</strong><br><br>For most of us the unknown is both friend and foe.

In the winter of 1864, George Tyron Harding, a Union solider&#x2014;a fifer who had once shaken President Lincoln&#x2019;s hand at the White House&#x2014;was sent home to the Harding family farm near Blooming Grove, Ohio, and his new wife, Phoebe Elizabeth Dickerson, to recover from jaundice. The war was over before Tyron could return to his troops, and much to Phoebe&#x2019;s relief, for she was carrying their first son, who arrived on November 2, 1865. Phoebe wanted to name him Winfield but her husband preferred a family name: Warren Gamaliel. Warren was Tyron&#x2019;s grandmother&#x2019;s maiden name, and Gamaliel an uncle&#x2019;s name that would prove to be prophetic. In the Bible, Gamaliel was noted for counseling moderation and calmness.Warren was the eldest of eight children with two dying during childhood. The Harding family, closely knit and loving, was described by one observer as &#x201c;a splendid state of harmony.&#x201d; While Winnie was still a baby, Tyron and Phoebe moved to their own small house also located on the Harding family farm property. By age four Harding was reading. Phoebe instructed her son using printed letters and word cards from her Sunday school class. Harding&#x2019;s precociousness was striking: &#x201c;A born talker, the boy was encouraged to enter his first oratorical contest at age four. A year later, when he heard bells toll, he piped up, &#x2018;They&#x2019;re ringing for [George] Washington. Some day they will ring for me.&#x2019; Phoebe repeatedly predicted that he would become President.&#x201d;1 The child also had his father&#x2019;s musical ear and talent, which could be heard by all the neighboring farmers when he was given a cornet at age nine.Tyron and Phoebe Harding wanted more for themselves and their children than life on a farm. Both studied and practiced homeopathic medicine. Tyron started reading medicine in the office of a local doctor while his son was an infant. Medical education at the time was commenced by studying with a local physician for about three years before going to medical school.2 After completing his medical training Harding&#x2019;s father both farmed and practiced medicine until the family moved to the small rural town of Caledonia, where Dr. Harding developed his medical practice. Phoebe, who commenced her studies a few years after her husband, developed an active rural and town practice as a midwife. Throughout his early years, as the eldest boy, Harding worked on the farm, an experience from which he drew understanding for this difficult business, and later, as president, he recognized their special problems.Dr. Harding was frequently paid by his patients with livestock, farm tools, or land. As a result he became an active trader and an inveterate (although not highly successful) investor. By 1876 the father of a future president had acquired an ownership interest in a local newspaper, the <i>Caledonia Argus.</i> This investment profoundly influenced his son&#x2019;s life. At the <i>Argus,</i> as an eleven-year-old boy, young Harding was introduced to the newspaper business when his father apprenticed him as a part-time printer&#x2019;s devil. Given the boy&#x2019;s facility with words, he quickly learned to set type. After assisting the <i>Argus</i> editor to prepare a difficult outside printing job, needed overnight by a local lawyer, Warren was rewarded with a printer&#x2019;s ruler&#x2014;a 13-em makeup ruler&#x2014;once known in the craft as the tool of a full-fledged printer. It became a prized possession and his good luck charm, which he kept with him the rest of his life.3Formal education for all the Harding children started in Caledonia&#x2019;s one-room schoolhouse, where they studied reading, writing, spelling, mathematics, history, and geography. A standard text of the day was the McGuffey&#x2019;s <i>Readers</i>, described appropriately as &#x201c;firmly didactic little books that formed the moralistic attitudes of generations of Americans.&#x201d;4 McGuffey&#x2019;s <i>Readers</i> (there are seven of them) introduced the Harding children to important writers and thinkers, including Harding&#x2019;s first heroes, Napoleon Bonaparte and Alexander Hamilton, with Hamilton later becoming a frequent and favorite subject of Harding&#x2019;s Chautauqua circuit speeches.School was not a great challenge for young Harding. His father told an interviewer during his son&#x2019;s 1920 campaign for the White House, &#x201c;He studied his lessons, I don&#x2019;t know when. I never caught him at it and it used to worry me, so I asked his teacher what Warren was doing to bring in such decent reports when he didn&#x2019;t seem to work. &#x2018;Oh, he&#x2019;s just naturally smart,&#x2019; his teacher said.&#x201d;5 Jack Warwick, a schoolmate and friend of Harding&#x2019;s, confirms the ease with which he went through his schoolwork.At fourteen years of age, in the fall of 1879, Warren entered Ohio Central College (no longer in existence), located in Iberia, Ohio. The teenager was a gangling but strong fellow, already six feet tall, with an olive complexion, blue eyes, and wavy black hair. He worked his way through college by painting houses and barns, and, during the summers, doing heavy construction work on railroad gradings. In fact, his sister Charity later claimed that Warren had worked too hard: &#x201c;During vacation days he helped neighbors thrash their grain and worked with all the men, and did as much as anyone, but he was only fourteen years old. He plowed and looked after much of the orchard work at this time on our farm. He helped with the construction work on the Ohio Central Railroad ... . He worked hard every day, in fact too hard for one so young. I have often thought, and so did he, after he was older, that such heavy work (when so young and developing so rapidly) was not conducive to a strong physical foundation for after life.&#x201d;6As a college student Harding most enjoyed his courses in literature and philosophy. Frank Harris, his college roommate, remembered he loved reading &#x201c;the masters of English prose.&#x201d; Other subjects were easily ignored until the last minute for Harding was good at cramming. Harris says his roommate would &#x201c;sit down with his face to the wall, head in hands and soak [a subject] up. Then when he was through, he would jump up with a yell and shout, &#x2018;Now, darn it, I&#x2019;ve got you,&#x2019; and slam the book against the wall.&#x201d;7 Foreshadowing his business career, Harding and Harris launched a college newspaper their last year at Ohio Central College, calling it the <i>Iberia Spectator</i>, addressing it to the entire town of Iberia. Francis Russell, a Harding biographer often critical of his subject, praises the <i>Iberia Spectator:</i> &#x201c;For the two young editors the little four-page journal was a creditable production, as lively as many a county paper, full of local items and jokes and advertisements, its editorials ranging over such varied topics as the anti-polygamy bill [in the U.S. Congress] and the aurora borealis. It was a popular venture. &#x2018;The <i>Spectator,</i>&#x2019; Harding noted editorially, &#x2018;is taken by every family in our city excepting a few stingy old grumblers who take no more interest in home enterprise than a mule takes in a hive of bees.&#x2019;&#x201d;8According to Harris, his handsome roommate knew every pretty girl within five miles of the college, and they &#x201c;frolicked together as innocently as young pups.&#x201d; Warren&#x2019;s mother, not to mention his sisters, had instructed him well on the ways and wiles of women. Warren enjoyed the company of women and they liked this tall, dark, and handsome man who talked and thought so dearly of his mother. Harding visited his mother every Sunday to bring her a bouquet of flowers. When he was later too far away to visit he arranged to have flowers delivered, a practice that continued throughout her lifetime. Childhood friend and later a Federal Reserve Board governor David R. Crissinger recalled the influence Harding&#x2019;s mother had on her son. &#x201c;The affection between them was one of the most beautiful things in Mr. Harding&#x2019;s career. She was an extremely religious soul, and the strong religious and ethical feeling which is so evident in all that President Harding wrote was inherited from her.&#x201d;9During his last year at college Harding&#x2019;s family moved to Marion, Ohio, which was about six miles from Caledonia. Upon his graduation in 1882, at seventeen years of age, he joined his family in Marion. With a population of 4,000, it was a true &#x201c;city&#x201d; for the young country lad with its roller-skating rink, pool hall, taverns, and even a couple of brothels. The town, which was served by three railroads, was booming and Dr. Harding&#x2019;s practice quickly flourished; he was soon earning $500 a month (equivalent to about $8,600 per month today), enabling the purchase of &#x201c;a fine house&#x201d; in the center of town. 10When Warren joined his family in Marion he needed a job, not to mention a career. He had no idea what to do with his life. He later explained, &#x201c;I did what was very much in practice at the time&#x2014;turned to teaching, in my abundant fullness of knowledge, having just come out of college.&#x201d;11 He taught grade-school pupils at a one-room schoolhouse just north of Marion for one term. As he told his aunt in a February 12, 1883, letter, teaching was not going to be his profession: &#x201c;Next Friday, one week, ... forever my career as a pedagogue will close, and&#x2014;oh, the joy! I believe my calling to be in some other sphere and will follow out the belief. I sincerely hope that my Winter&#x2019;s labors are not lost but that those with whom I labored are somewhat benefited. How often it is that one&#x2019;s most arduous toils are without appreciation! I will never teach again without better (a good deal, too) wages, and an advanced school.&#x201d;12</p><h2>Red Horizons: The True Story of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescus&#39; Crimes, Lifestyle, and Corruption (Cold War Classics)</h2><p>A former chief of Romania&#39;s foreign intelligence service reveals the extraordinary corruption of the Nicolae Ceausescu government of Romania, its brutal machinery of oppression, and its Machiavellian relationship with the West.

A relative unknown at the time, Sargent won the commission to paint her; the two must have recognized in each other a like-minded hunger for fame. <br><br> Unveiled at the 1884 Paris Salon, Gautreau's portrait generated the attention she craved-but it led to infamy rather than stardom. Sargent had painted one strap of Gautreau's dress dangling from her shoulder, suggesting either the prelude to or the aftermath of sex. Her reputation irreparably damaged, Gautreau retired from public life, destroying all the mirrors in her home. <br><br> Drawing on documents from private collections and other previously unexamined materials, and featuring a cast of characters including Oscar Wilde and Richard Wagner, Strapless is a tale of art and celebrity, obsession and betrayal.</p><p>Deborah Davis is the author of <i>Party of the Century: The Fabulous Story of Truman Capote and his Black and White Ball</i> (Wiley, April 2006), and <i>Strapless: John Singer Sargent and the Fall of Madame X</i> (Tarcher/Putnam, 2003).

Quality Dover score.</p><p><p>Jean Cocteau labeled this revolutionary work "a pastorale of the prehistoric world" at its premiere in Paris in 1913, when interest in primitivism was at its zenith among the avant-garde. These "Scenes of Pagan Russia" did indeed inspire primitive reactions among their opening night audience, who were so vociferous in their protests that the dancers could scarcely hear the music.<br>Yet this powerful work, with its novel rhythms and hitherto unheard-of chordal combinations and orchestral effects would change forever the elements of musical language and exert an enormous influence on three generations of composers. Once a scandal, it is now perhaps the most famous orchestral work of the twentieth century. It is reprinted here from the full-score Russian edition published in 1965.<br>Like Stravinsky's scores for <i>The Firebird</i> and <i>Petrushka, The Rite of Spring</i> was commissioned by Serge Diaghilev for the Ballets Russes. Choreographed by Nijinsky, it is still a favorite of ballet audiences, and the score is one of the most performed and recorded modern works in the orchestral repertoire. Now music lovers can enjoy every note of this brilliant and stirring landmark of twentieth-century music, faithfully reproduced in this inexpensive, high-quality edition&#x2014;ideal for study and for following both live and recorded performances.</p><p></p><p>The leading composer of his day, Igor Stravinsky experimented with virtually every technique of 20th century music. Throughout his long and prolific career, he produced symphonies, concertos, choral works, operas, and ballets.</p><p></p></p><h2>Ballet Shoes (The Shoe Books)</h2><p><b>Three orphan girls.

They are orphans who have been raised as sisters, and when their new family needs money, the girls want to help. They decide to join the Children's Academy of Dancing and Stage Training to earn their keep. Each girl works hard following her dream. Pauline is destined for the movies. Posy is a born dancer. And Petrova? She finds she'd rather be a pilot than perform a pirouette.<br><br>This beautiful children's classic is perfect for girls who love to dream about ballet, friendship, and finding their own special talents. Adult readers may remember them as the "Shoes" books from <i>You've Got Mail</i>!</p><p><b>Noel Streatfeild</b> was born in Sussex in 1895 and was one of three sisters. Although she was considered the plain one she ended up leading the most glamorous and exciting life! After working in munitions factories and canteens for the armed forces when WWI broke out, Noel followed her dream of being on stage and went to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, where she became a professional actress. She began writing children's books in 1931 and <i>Ballet Shoes</i> was published in 1936. She quickly became one of the most popular authors of her day. When she visited Puffin exhibitions, there were queues right out of the building and all the way down the Mall. She was one of the first winners of the Carnegie Medal and was awarded an OBE in 1983. Noel Streatfeild lived in London. She died in 1986.<p>The Fossil sisters lived in the Cromwell Road. At that end of it which is farthest away from the Brompton Road, and yet sufficiently near it so one could be taken to look at the dolls&#x2019; houses in the Victoria and Albert every wet day. If the weather were not too wet, one was expected to &#x201c;save the penny and walk.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Saving the penny and walking was a great feature of their lives.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Gum,&#x201d; Pauline, the oldest, would say, &#x201c;must have been a very taxi person; he couldn&#x2019;t have ever thought about walking or he&#x2019;d never have bought a house at the far end of the longest road in London.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I expect,&#x201d; Petrova, the second, would argue, &#x201c;he had a motorcar all his own, and he never hired anything.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> G.U.M. was the quick way of saying Great-Uncle Matthew. He was a legendary figure to the children, as he had gone on a voyage, and not come back, before any of them were old enough to remember him clearly. He had, however, been of the utmost importance in their lives.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s been,&#x201d; Pauline once said, &#x201c;like the stork in the fairy tale. He very nearly did bring us in his beak.&#x201d; Storks in the Fossil children&#x2019;s nursery were always called Gums after that.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gum had been a very important person. He had collected some of the finest fossils in the world, and though to many people fossils may not seem to be very interesting things to collect, there are others who find them as absorbing as sensible collections, such as stamps. Collecting fossils, he naturally needed somewhere to put them, and that is how he came to buy the house in the Cromwell Road. It had large rooms, and about six floors, including the basement, and on every floor, and in almost every room, he kept fossils. Naturally a house like that needed somebody to look after it, and he found just the right person. Gum had one nephew, who had died leaving a widow and a little girl. What was more suitable than to invite the widow and her child Sylvia, and Nana her nurse, to live in the house and take care of it for him? Ten years later the widowed niece died, but by then his great-niece Sylvia was sixteen, so she, helped by Nana, took her mother&#x2019;s place, and saw that the house and the fossils were all right.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sometimes when the house got too full Nana would say:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Now, Miss Sylvia dear, you must tell your uncle not another fossil until a few have gone out of the door.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Sylvia hated saying this, but she was far too much in awe of Nana to do anything else. Terrible upsets were the result. First Gum said no fossil would leave the house except over his dead body. Then, when he&#x2019;d toned down a little and realized some had to go, in spite of his body being anything but dead, he would collect a few small, rather bad specimens and give them away. Then, after a day or two, during which he mooned round the house under Nana&#x2019;s stern eyes and Sylvia&#x2019;s rather sorry ones, a notice would suddenly appear in The Times, to say that Professor Matthew Brown had given another generous gift of fossils to a museum. That meant that men would come with packing-cases and take some of the most important (which often meant the largest) fossils away. Nana would settle down with a sigh of contentment to cleaning those places where the fossils had stood, and Sylvia would comfort Gum by listening to his descriptions of where he was going to look for some more.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was while looking for some more that the accident happened which put an end to Gum&#x2019;s fossil-hunting forever. He had climbed a mountain after a particular specimen, and he slipped and fell hundreds of feet, and crushed his leg so badly that he had to have it taken off.<br> &nbsp;<br> You would have thought that a man who lived for nothing but fossils would have felt that there was nothing left to do when he couldn&#x2019;t go and look for them anymore, but Gum wasn&#x2019;t that sort of man.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have traveled a lot on land, my dear,&#x201d; he said to Sylvia, &#x201c;but very little by sea. Now I shall really see the world. And maybe I&#x2019;ll be finding something interesting to bring back.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no need to do that, sir,&#x201d; Nana broke in firmly. &#x201c;The house is full enough as it is. We don&#x2019;t want a lot of carved elephants and that about the place.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Carved elephants!&#x201d; Gum gave Nana a scornful look. &#x201c;The world is full of entrancements, woman, any of which I might bring home, and you talk to me of carved elephants!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But Nana held her ground.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All right, sir; I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;m pleased you should see these entrancements, as you call them, but you let them bide. We want nothing more in this house.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The entrancement that Gum actually brought home was Pauline.<br> &nbsp;<br> The ship on which he was traveling struck an iceberg, and all the passengers had to take to the boats. In the night one of the boats filled with water and the passengers were thrown into the sea. Gum&#x2019;s boat went to the rescue, but by the time it got there everybody was drowned except a baby who was lying on a lifebelt, cooing happily. Gum collected the baby and wrapped her in his coat, and when they were at last rescued by a liner and taken to England, tried to find out to whom she belonged. That was the trouble. Nobody knew for sure whose baby she was; there had been other babies on board, and three were missing. She must go to an orphanage for female orphans, said everybody; but Gum said &#x201c;No&#x201d; to that. Things he found went to the Cromwell Road. He had meant to bring Sylvia back a present. Now, what could be better than this? He fussed and fumed while the adoption papers were made out, then he tucked the baby into the crook of his left arm, took his shabby old holdall in his right, and limping because of his game leg, walked to the railway station, and went home to London and the Cromwell Road.<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>The Complete Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs &amp; Prehistoric Creatures: The Ultimate Illustrated Reference Guide to 1000 Dinosaurs and Prehistoric ...

Few people have known this better than Syd Field, who dissected thousands of films and screenplays in order to discern the vital elements that all great screenplays share. His books, lectures, workshops, and classes brought clarity and confidence to a great many accomplished screenwriters, a quartet of whom are featured in this one book:&nbsp;<br><ul><li>Callie Khouri,&nbsp;in her first film script -&nbsp;<i>Thelma &amp; Louise -</i>&nbsp;rewrote the rules for road movies by challenging long-entrenched gender stereotypes to create a revolutionary American classic.</li></ul><ul><li>James Cameron,&nbsp;writer/director of&nbsp;<i>Avatar&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Titanic</i>, is also responsible for&nbsp;<i>Terminator 2: Judgement Day,&nbsp;</i>in which he&nbsp;crafted a sequel integrating innovative special effects and storyline that transformed the Terminator - a quintessential killing machine - into a&nbsp;sympathetic character.&nbsp;<i>This</i>&nbsp;is how spectacular action films are written.</li></ul><ul><li>Ted Tally&nbsp;adapted Thomas Harris' chilling 350-page bestseller,&nbsp;<i>The Silence of the Lambs,&nbsp;</i>into a riveting 120-page script - a critical lesson in the specialized art and craft of adapting novels for film.</li></ul><ul><li>Michael Blake<i>,&nbsp;</i>in&nbsp;<i>Dances with Wolves,&nbsp;</i>achieved every writer's dream as he translated his own&nbsp;epic novel into an uncompromising film. Learn how he leveraged the theme of transformation as a spiritual dynamic in this memorable work of mythic sweep.</li></ul>Informative and utterly engrossing,&nbsp;<i>Four Screenplays</i>&nbsp;belongs in every writer's library, next to Field's highly acclaimed companion volumes:&nbsp;<i>Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting, The Screenwriter's Workbook, The Screenwriter's Problem Solver&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Selling a Screenplay.</i><i></i><i></i></p><p>In a field being transformed by technology, Syd Field shows you what works and why and how to find new ways to create a truly outstanding film using four extraordinary examples: <i>Thelma &amp; Louise</i>, <i>Terminator 2: Judgement Day</i>, <i>The Silence Of The Lambs</i>, and <i>Dances With Wolves</i>.<p> "I based <i>Like Water For Chocolate</i> on what I learned in Syd's books. Before, I always felt structure imprisoned me, but what I learned was structure really freed me to focus on the story." -- Laura Esquivel</p>Screenwriting is a craft that occasionally rises to the level of an art. Like film, it is a unique and special form that is constantly shifting and changing, mirroring the needs and concerns of our time. As a result, each generation brings a new eye and a new sensibility to the screenplay. The&nbsp;screenplay is a unique form; it is neither&nbsp;novel nor play but combines elements of both. A screenplay is a story told with pictures in dialogue and description&nbsp;placed within the context of dramatic structure.&nbsp;Structure&nbsp; is the foundation of all screenwriting - it is the spine, the skeleton that "holds" it all together. My approach to these four screenplays is from a structural perspective. Screenplay structure is like a good road map through the desert, showing you all the necessary&nbsp;things you need to know before you begin the journey. It is both guide and support, and like a tree in the wind that bends but doesn't break, structure is flexible.-- <i>From the Introduction: Four Themes, Four Screenplays</i></p><h2>The Triumph of Injustice: How the Rich Dodge Taxes and How to Make Them Pay</h2><p><p><strong>America&#x2019;s runaway inequality has an engine: our unjust tax system.</strong></p><p>Even as they became fabulously wealthy, the ultra-rich have had their taxes collapse to levels last seen in the 1920s. Meanwhile, working-class Americans have been asked to pay more. <em>The Triumph of Injustice</em> presents a forensic investigation into this dramatic transformation, written by two economists who revolutionized the study of inequality. Eschewing anecdotes and case studies, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman offer a comprehensive view of America&#x2019;s tax system, based on new statistics covering all taxes paid at all levels of government. Their conclusion? For the first time in more than a century, billionaires now pay lower tax rates than their secretaries.</p><p>Blending history and cutting-edge economic analysis, and writing in lively and jargon-free prose, Saez and Zucman dissect the deliberate choices (and sins of indecision) that have brought us to today: the gradual exemption of capital owners; the surge of a new tax avoidance industry, and the spiral of tax competition among nations. With clarity and concision, they explain how America turned away from the most progressive tax system in history to embrace policies that only serve to compound the wealth of a few.</p><p>But <em>The Triumph of Injustice</em> is much more than a laser-sharp analysis of one of the great political and intellectual failures of our time. Saez and Zucman propose a visionary, democratic, and practical reinvention of taxes, outlining reforms that can allow tax justice to triumph in today&#x2019;s globalized world and democracy to prevail over concentrated wealth.</p><p>A pioneering companion website allows anyone to evaluate proposals made by the authors, and to develop their own alternative tax reform at taxjusticenow.org.</p></p><p><p><strong>Emmanuel Saez</strong> is professor of economics and director of the Center for Equitable Growth at the University of California, Berkeley. His research focuses on tax policy and inequality from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. With Thomas Piketty, he has constructed long-run historical series of income inequality in the United States that have been widely discussed in public debate. He received his PhD in economics from MIT in 1999. He was awarded the John Bates Clark Medal of the American Economic Association in 2009 and a MacArthur Fellowship in 2010.</p><p><strong>Gabriel Zucman</strong> is professor of economics and public policy at the University of California, Berkeley. His research analyzes the accumulation and distribution of wealth through global and historical perspectives. He received his PhD in economics from the Paris School of Economics in 2013. He was awarded the Bern�cer Prize in 2018 and a Sloan Research Fellowship in 2019. He is the author of <em>The Hidden Wealth of Nations: The Scourge of Tax Havens</em>, which has been translated into eighteen languages.</p>&#x201c;[T]he most important book on government policy that I&#x2019;ve read in a long time.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>David Leonhardt, <em>New York Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;One of the best books I&#x2019;ve read this year. Crystal clear, rigorously empirical. Should be read by policymakers from around the globe, especially in the US. It&#x2019;s <em>the</em> to-do-list for the next president.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Rutger Bregman, author of <em>Utopia for Realists</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In 2018, for the first time in more than one hundred years, billionaires paid a lower tax rate than ordinary workers, crowning the dismantling of America&#x2019;s system of progressive taxation. In this eye-opening book, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman show that there is no iron law of economics that led us there, just many whose self-interest or misunderstanding of economics make them claim the opposite. Their radical proposal to reinvent taxation for a globalized world will become an unavoidable starting point to any intelligent conversation.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Esther Duflo, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics and author of <em>Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;America is tired with inequality and oligarchy. Armed with eye-popping new data, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman reveal how tax injustice is fueling the oligarchic drift. But above all, they propose bold solutions to help America reconnect with its tradition of tax justice, from the taxation of extreme wealth and giant corporations to the funding of health care for all. This is a brilliantly argued book that is an essential contribution to the global economic and political debate of the twenty-first century.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Thomas Piketty, author of <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>The Triumph of Injustice</em> is a groundbreaking work that uncovers a diabolical driver of America&#x2019;s shocking and growing inequality: unfair and regressive tax policies and a tax avoidance industry that serves the wealthy at the expense of everyone else. Until we reverse this topsy-turvy regime&#x2015;where ordinary workers may pay a larger share of their income than the very richest Americans&#x2015;we can&#x2019;t hope to address our biggest social problems. Anyone who hopes for a better future for everyday Americans needs to read this book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Joseph E. Stiglitz, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics and author of <em>People, Power, and Profits: Progressive Capitalism for an Age of Discontent</em></strong></p><h2>Bi: Notes for a Bisexual Revolution</h2><p><b>"A groundbreaking exploration of bisexual politics by a revolutionary thinker" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) provides the missing piece of the puzzle for readers who identify as bisexual</b><br>Depicted as duplicitous, traitorous, and promiscuous, bisexuality has long been suspected, marginalized, and rejected by both straight and gay communities alike.<br><i>Bi</i> takes a long overdue, comprehensive look at bisexual politics, from the issues surrounding biphobia/monosexism, feminism, and transgenderism to the practice of labeling those who identify as bi as either "too bisexual" (promiscuous and incapable of fidelity) or "not bisexual enough" (not actively engaging romantically or sexually with people of at least two different genders). In this forward-thinking and eye-opening book, feminist bisexual and genderqueer activist Shiri Eisner takes readers on a journey through the many aspects of the meanings and politics of bisexuality, specifically highlighting how bisexuality can open up new and exciting ways of challenging social convention.<br>Informed by feminist, transgender, and queer theory, as well as politics and activism, <i>Bi</i> is a radical manifesto for a group that has been too frequently silenced, erased, and denied--and a starting point from which to launch a bisexual revolution.</p><p><b>Shiri Eisner</b> is a feminist bisexual and genderqueer activist, writer, and researcher. Eisner lives in Tel Aviv, Israel."Brilliant! I have been waiting twenty years for a book like this. It should be required reading for any person even considering entering the dialogue about where the 'B' fits in the LGBT world. Let the revolution begin."<br> <b>Kyle Schickner</b>, Bi Activist/Filmmaker<br><br> <i>Bi: Notes for a Bisexual Revolution</i> is a groundbreaking exploration of bisexual politics by a revolutionary thinker.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br> This is the most innovative and exciting book to be published on bisexuality in many years, and one which will move work in this area forward in many vital ways. Eisner weaves together bisexual theory and activism with related areas in a sophisticated and rigorous manner that enriches both the field of bisexuality and those that are drawn into dialogue with it. In particular, the explorations of racialization and the conversations between bisexual activism and the politics of global conflicts are highly original, thought-provoking, and important. Throughout the book Eisner challenges existing practices, such as biphobia and 'mythbusting&#x2019; of bisexual stereotypes, and puts forward intriguing and valuable alternatives. The book will be helpful far beyond the bisexual movement itself and is a must-read for feminists, LBG&amp;T workers, critical race and queer theorists and activists particularly.&#x201d;<br> <b>Meg Barker</b>, author of <i>The Bisexuality Report</i><br><br> <i>Bi: Notes for a Bisexual Revolution</i> is a brilliant and comprehensive look at where the bisexual movement has been, and where it should head in the future. Rather than merely denying or debunking the countless accusations and stereotypes that plague bisexuality (as many past writers have done), Shiri Eisner exposes the underlying assumptions and misconceptions about sex, gender, and sexuality that give rise to societal monosexism and biphobia. A must read, not only for those of us who fall under the bisexual umbrella, but for feminists, queer and trans activists, and anyone who is concerned with social justice.&#x201d;<br> <b>Julia Serano</b>, author of <i>Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity</i> and <i>Excluded: Making Feminist and Queer Movements More Inclusive</i><br><br> <i>Bi: Notes for a Bisexual Revolution</i> is a breath of fresh air. So much of sexual-political activism and writing these days seems to seek acceptance by mainstream society rather than profound change. <i>Bi: Notes for a Bisexual Revolution</i> steps right outside of that. It is far and away the most significant analysis of bisexuality published this century.&#x201d;<br> <b>Sue George</b>, author of <i>Women and Bisexuality</i> and blogger at Bisexuality and Beyond<br><br> Shiri Eisner unpacks bisexuality and the bisexual experience, challenging monosexism&#x2019; privilege in a refreshing, clear, unwavering voice. But, instead of the usual narratives of bi activism, Eisner brings us a global, radical&#x201d; vision, recognizing the seemingly endless battle for mere acknowledgement as whole people, while taking us further toward a bi revolution.&#x201d; Make no mistake: Shiri Eisner offers us more than a fresh voice for a new generation of bi activism; Eisner offers us all a call to action.&#x201d;<br> <b>William E. Burleson</b>, author of <i>Bi America: Myths, Truths, and Struggles of an Invisible Community</i><br><br> Shiri Eisner has deftly woven a fresh, clear, subtle, and profound analysis of the revolutionary potential of bisexuality. I wholeheartedly recommend this passionate, engaging, and thought-provoking book to anyone who cares about the intersections of gender, sexuality, and social justice.&#x201d;<br> <b>Jamie Heckert, PhD</b>, co-editor of <i>Anarchism &amp; Sexuality: Ethics, Relationships and Power</i><br><br> What a joy! Hurrah, hurrah. Decades after we birthed our bi US anthology, Eisner&#x2019;s practical tips for organizers, brain food for theory-heads, and inspirational proposals offer a visionary trans-national approach that takes bi experiences and identities to new levels, depths, breadths.

It was after eight o&#x2019;clock, and Savich was on his way home from a hard workout at the gym. He felt good, his muscles relaxed and warm, and he looked forward to playing with Sean, maybe with his new video game, Wonky Wizards. He breathed in deeply, enjoying the bite of fall in the air. He looked up at the low-lying clouds that promised to bring a shower in the next couple of hours. Nonfat milk and Fritos and&#x2014;what else?</p><p>There was only one car in the parking lot, which wasn&#x2019;t unusual at this time of the evening. A strange play of rapid movement behind the store&#x2019;s large glass window caught his eye. He pulled the Porsche to the far side of the parking lot, out of the line of sight, got out, quietly closed the car door, and walked to the edge of the window. He could see a man inside, his face flattened in a leg of panty hose, standing in front of the counter, pointing a Saturday night special at Mr. Patil&#x2019;s chest. Mr. Patil, who wasn&#x2019;t more than five-five with lifts in his shoes and was at least seventy-five years old, looked petrified. Savich watched his hands shoot into the air above his head. He could hear the man yelling at him, but couldn&#x2019;t make out what he was saying. Then he saw a customer. At the end of the counter stood a man about his own age, wearing a bright red Redskins sweatshirt, jeans, and glasses.</p><p>Savich felt his heart seize.</p><p>Pressed against the man&#x2019;s legs were two small children, a boy and a girl. His hands were wrapped around their shoulders, hugging them tightly against him. Each child held an ice-cream bar, now forgotten.</p><p><i>Keep it together.</i> He couldn&#x2019;t call 911, and take the chance of sirens freaking the guy out, not with the kids still in the line of fire. He quickly ran around to the back of the Shop &#x2019;n Go and heard the engine running before he saw the Chevy Impala, tucked in the shadows off the parking asphalt. He saw a woman in the driver&#x2019;s seat, leaning in toward the passenger&#x2019;s side to get a partial view inside the store. Since she wasn&#x2019;t wearing panty hose on her head, she obviously wasn&#x2019;t slated to join the actual robbery; she was just there to drive the man in the store out of here. Savich couldn&#x2019;t see the license plate. No matter. She hadn&#x2019;t seen him. Good.</p><p><i>Forget her, let her get away.</i> He crouched down and ran back around to the front of the store. He held his SIG at his side and began whistling. He opened the door and called out, &#x201c;Good evening, Mr. Patil,&#x201d; and the man in the panty hose whirled around, his gun leading, as the little girl yelled, &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll hurt you!&#x201d;</p><p>The man froze for the longest instant of time in Savich&#x2019;s memory. Savich saw the father grab the children and hurl them to the floor, and then he fell over them while Mr. Patil hefted a six-pack of beer the man had brought to the counter. Then Savich&#x2019;s SIG was up, and he fired. The rule was always to fire only when you intended to kill, but the bullet didn&#x2019;t go into the man&#x2019;s chest, it went into his shoulder. The man screamed, fell hard to his knees, clutching his shoulder, and the .22 went flying.</p><p>Savich listened for the Impala&#x2019;s engine to rev, for the car to roar out of there, but he didn&#x2019;t hear anything except a car door slamming shut. He yelled, &#x201c;Mr. Patil, get down!&#x201d; Savich dropped to the floor and was rolling when the door burst open and a submachine gun started blasting bullets. He heard Mr. Patil scream from behind the counter, knew he hadn&#x2019;t been fast enough and she&#x2019;d hit him. He heard the kids screaming, heard the father&#x2019;s deep voice, hazed over with fear, saying, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, it will be all right.&#x201d; He came up and fired, hit the woman square between the eyes as she swung the gun around toward him. The submachine gun hit the linoleum floor and fetched hard against the counter.</p><p>Savich saw Mr. Patil leaning heavily on the counter, a bloom of red on his right arm. He jumped up and quickly checked the gunman, pulled the stocking off his face. He was white, about forty, heavyset, his light brown hair seriously thinning. He moaned, holding his shoulder, the bullet still in him. He was lucky the bullet hadn&#x2019;t hit an artery. He&#x2019;d survive. Savich picked up the .22 and said, &#x201c;Keep pressing down on that,&#x201d; and then he went down on his knees beside the woman. Like the man, she was white, fortyish, but she was dead. Her dark eyes were open. A dribble of blood came out of her mouth, and the hole between her eyes was a perfect red dot. Blood haloed her head.</p><p><i>Please keep their eyes covered.</i></p><p>He quickly pulled off his leather jacket and covered the woman&#x2019;s face. He ran back to Mr. Patil and examined the bullet wound. Through and through, thank God. &#x201c;You did great, sir. You&#x2019;re going to be okay.&#x201d; Savich grabbed a wad of paper towels from next to the coffee machine and pressed them against Mr. Patil&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Press as hard as you can, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>He called 911 and asked for two ambulances and the police. He looked over at the father, still covering his children on the floor. Both children were quiet now, their father murmuring against their heads, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, kids, everything&#x2019;s okay now&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Savich looked back at the wounded man, saw he wasn&#x2019;t moving or making a sound. He came down on his haunches, laid his hand lightly on the man&#x2019;s shoulder. He was a big guy, pretty fit, his face less ashen now that he realized they&#x2019;d all survived. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;m FBI. You did great; you kept your kids safe. Everything&#x2019;s under control now. The police will be here soon. You&#x2019;re a very brave man; it&#x2019;s a pleasure to meet you,&#x201d; and Savich stuck out his hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Dillon Savich.&#x201d;</p><p>The man slowly stood, bringing the children with him, still pressed against his legs. He straightened his glasses and gave Savich a shaky grin. He started to say something, then lost the words, the wild adrenaline rush choking them off. He took Savich&#x2019;s hand, shook it really hard, and at last he managed to say, &#x201c;I can hear my own heart beating so heavy, it&#x2019;s like it&#x2019;s going to fly out of my chest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the adrenaline. Believe me, in a couple of minutes you&#x2019;re going to crash.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I can&#x2019;t do that, not with the kids here. Hey, I&#x2019;m Dave Raditch. Thank you for coming in like that, so sharp and fast. I don&#x2019;t know what the guy was going to do; he might have shot all of us. It sure looked like he was going to kill Mr. Patil. Hush, Michael, everything&#x2019;s okay. Hold Crissy&#x2019;s hand, okay?&#x201d;</p><p>Savich prayed Dave wouldn&#x2019;t bottom out completely after the adrenaline snapped out of him and fall over. He&#x2019;d seen it before. He looked closely at Dave Raditch, saw he was occupied with stroking those small shuddering bodies, keeping them very close. Savich smiled at him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll do fine,&#x201d; he said, and smiled down at Michael. Then, because it could have been Sean, Savich hugged him. As Savich pressed Michael&#x2019;s face against him, he thought, how would he deal with this violent terror? With the shock of sudden bloody death? As he rubbed his big hands up and down Michael&#x2019;s back, he said, &#x201c;Michael, I really need your help. The police will be here soon, and I&#x2019;ll have to speak with them. I want you to hunker down with your dad and sister and talk about what happened, because the police will want to speak with you, too. Do you think you can keep them calm? Can you do that for me?&#x201d;</p><p>Michael hiccuped, wiped the back of his hand over his running nose, and slowly pulled back in Savich&#x2019;s arms. He looked over at the man moaning on the floor, holding his shoulder, his blood everywhere. Then Michael looked at the woman Mr. Savich had covered with his leather jacket. Michael knew she was dead, knew dead meant she wouldn&#x2019;t wake up. And there was Mr. Patil, and he was hurt, too, that woman had shot him, but because he&#x2019;d heard Mr. Savich tell Mr. Patil he was going to be okay, Michael didn&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;d have to worry about him. He tried to straighten his shoulders and said, &#x201c;I can do that, sir,&#x201d; in the most convincing imitation adult voice Savich had ever heard. What was he? Five years old? Sean&#x2019;s age. Thank God Sean hadn&#x2019;t been with him.</p><p>&#x201c;Crissy, it&#x2019;s okay now,&#x201d; Michael said as he patted his sister&#x2019;s back. &#x201c;Dad, Mr. Savich said the police are coming and we&#x2019;ve got to get our stories straight.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Well, close enough.</i> Savich smiled.</p><p>Dave Raditch&#x2019;s left eyebrow shot up above his glasses. He didn&#x2019;t know where it came from, but when he met Savich&#x2019;s eyes, he grinned, nodded, but only for an instant, because Crissy&#x2019;s face was leached of color and she was shuddering like she had a fever. He cleared his throat. &#x201c;Okay, Crissy, Michael&#x2019;s right, we&#x2019;ve gotta tell the police exactly what happened before Mr. Savich came in. How about the three of us go over there by the potato chips and talk about how this went down, okay?&#x201d;</p><p>Crissy Raditch turned to stare at the woman, and then licked her lips. &#x201c;Did Mr. Savich shoot her dead?&#x201d;</p><p><i>This is the big one.</i> Savich said, &#x201c;Yes, I had to, Crissy. I couldn&#x2019;t take the chance she would hurt any of us. Now go with your dad and Michael and work this all out.&#x201d;</p><p>Savich watched Dave Raditch herd his children behind the chip stand, out of sight of the devastation.</p><p>He looked at the dead woman, at the trail of blood seeping from beneath his leather jacket. Had she ever considered she might die at 8:27 on a Tuesday night?</p><p>He heard sirens.</p><p>He looked over at the kids&#x2019; two ice-cream bars melting on the floor, and then at the big round clock behind Mr. Patil&#x2019;s counter. He watched the minute hand reach 8:28. Only a couple of minutes had passed, a couple of minutes that determined who would live and who would die.</p><p><i><b>CHAPTER 2</b></i></p><p><i>Cleveland, Ohio</i> <br><i>Nielson&#x2019;s Bar &amp; Grill</i> <br><i>Tuesday night</i></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>He said his name was Thaddeus, and he was sort of shy when he asked her if he could buy her a Burning River Pale Ale.

This is such a book. Max Born is a Nobel Laureate (1955) and one of the world's great physicists: in this book he analyzes and interprets the theory of Einsteinian relativity. The result is undoubtedly the most lucid and insightful of all the books that have been written to explain the revolutionary theory that marked the end of the classical and the beginning of the modern era of physics.<br>The author follows a quasi-historical method of presentation. The book begins with a review of the classical physics, covering such topics as origins of space and time measurements, geometric axioms, Ptolemaic and Copernican astronomy, concepts of equilibrium and force, laws of motion, inertia, mass, momentum and energy, Newtonian world system (absolute space and absolute time, gravitation, celestial mechanics, centrifugal forces, and absolute space), laws of optics (the corpuscular and undulatory theories, speed of light, wave theory, Doppler effect, convection of light by matter), electrodynamics (including magnetic induction, electromagnetic theory of light, electromagnetic ether, electromagnetic laws of moving bodies, electromagnetic mass, and the contraction hypothesis). Born then takes up his exposition of Einstein's special and general theories of relativity, discussing the concept of simultaneity, kinematics, Einstein's mechanics and dynamics, relativity of arbitrary motions, the principle of equivalence, the geometry of curved surfaces, and the space-time continuum, among other topics. Born then points out some predictions of the theory of relativity and its implications for cosmology, and indicates what is being sought in the unified field theory.<br>This account steers a middle course between vague popularizations and complex scientific presentations. This is a careful discussion of principles stated in thoroughly acceptable scientific form, yet in a manner that makes it possible for the reader who has no scientific training to understand it. Only high school algebra has been used in explaining the nature of classical physics and relativity, and simple experiments and diagrams are used to illustrate each step. The layman and the beginning student in physics will find this an immensely valuable and usable introduction to relativity. This Dover 1962 edition was greatly revised and enlarged by Dr. Born.<br><br><br></p></p><p>fm.author_biographical_note1</p><h2>Tevye the Dairyman and Motl the Cantor&#39;s Son (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><p><b>For the 150th anniversary of the birth of the "Jewish Mark Twain,"a new translation of his most famous works</b></p><br> <i>Tevye the Dairyman and Motl the Cantor's Son</i> are the most celebrated characters in all of Jewish fiction.

Then, the family having moved back to Peryeslav, he attended a Russian high school&#x2014;his father&#x2019;s partial exposure to modernity (as a follower of the Hebrew Enlightenment) made this possible. Thus he amassed Jewish booklore, was fully proficient as a Hebraist, and was inspired by modern Russian literature and liberal ideals. A scion of the old-style Jewish middle class (the family&#x2019;s business was the cutting and shipping of timber)&#x2014;which, under the circumstances of the relatively advanced capitalism in Russia of the late nineteenth century, came down in the world&#x2014;he was motivated since childhood by two dreams: to become fabulously rich and to become a famous Jewish writer who would elevate Jewish literature to the level of its Russian counterpart. The former dream sent him to the stock exchanges of Kiev and Odessa, where he squandered the considerable wealth of his in-laws, the Loyev family. (That fiasco engendered his first literary masterpiece, an epistolary story based on the correspondence of the misguided speculator and broker Menachem-Mendl and his wife Sheyne-Sheynd, which he started in 1892.) The second dream he managed, to a considerable extent, to realize.</p><p>Initially Rabinovitch intended to become either a Russian or a Hebrew writer. (He would try both options with scant success.) But in 1883 he &#x201c;bumped,&#x201d; as if by accident, into Yiddish, the spoken language of eastern European Jews, and soon became obsessed with the <i>meshugas,</i> the dizzying idiomatic energy of that language as a writing tool. No one else was to tap the immense resources of Yiddish as he did, while endowing his entire corpus, no matter how varying and uneven the artistic level of its many hundreds of units (the twenty-eight volumes of his official collected edition barely cover half of his output), with unparalleled linguistic �lan and unflagging rhythmic drive.</p><p>In the 1880s the use of Yiddish did not bestow upon a writer literary status, so the young author, driven by high ambitions, decided to gentrify and elevate it forthwith as the language of a respectable European literature. He proceeded to publish &#x201c;thick&#x201d; and very selective literary almanacs in the contemporary Russian format; launched a critical campaign against Yiddish <i>Schund</i> (trash) and for realism in Yiddish writing; and produced a series of realist novels that he dubbed &#x201c;Jewish novels,&#x201d; which tried to synthesize romance (considered an essential ingredient of the novel genre) and realities of the Jewish traditional milieu (where romance was not allowed to play an important role). In the process he managed to establish intimate contact with the then rapidly growing Yiddish reading public through the &#x201c;funny&#x201d; persona Sholem Aleichem (an absurd appellation meaning &#x201c;how d&#x2019;you do&#x201d;). Comic, folksy personae were rife in Yiddish writing of the time, mediating between the semitraditional, barely educated reading public and modernist, &#x201c;enlightened&#x201d; authors. In this respect and in others Sholem Rabinovitch learned much from the practices of his mentor Sh. Y. Abramovitch and his persona Mendele the Book Peddler. However, Sholem Aleichem, crafted as a whimsical, clever, high-spirited, but quite unruly and unpredictable vagabond, caught the imagination of the readers as did no other persona. People fell in love with his jocular causerie and regarded him as a welcome guest. The success of the persona was such that Rabinovitch could not afford to part with it, and its features merged with the core of his literary-performative identity.</p><p>This was one reason that novel writing, in spite of the author&#x2019;s high aspirations, never became his highest level of achievement. As a chatty, omniscient narrator, Sholem Aleichem rarely allowed for a sophisticated novelistic synthesis. Always aware of the limitations of the reading public, he simplified and overexplained his characters and their interactions and insisted on being entertaining even where the narrative hardly justified his intervention. His stories were far more subtle; in them, the characters were allowed to speak for themselves, and Sholem Aleichem was reduced to the role of a silent but omnipresent interlocutor, one whom the characters wished to impress, cajole, or even attack. Informed by this formula, the author created his chief masterpieces, <i>Tevye der milkhiker</i> (<i>Tevye the Dairyman,</i> started in 1894) foremost among them. Here and in a long series of brilliant monologues written between 1900 and 1910, Sholem Aleichem, having &#x201c;regressed&#x201d; from the novelistic synthesis to its &#x201c;primitive&#x201d; rudiments (monologue, letter), achieved the shimmering brilliance of a world-class master.</p><p>Following the failed revolution of 1905 and the subsequent pogroms, he decided to leave forever his Ukrainian homeland. He tried and failed to establish himself as a playwright in New York, then began a life of wandering in western and central Europe. In summer 1908 he collapsed with an attack of open pulmonary tuberculosis, which for some years bound him to sanatoria and southern winter resorts. The pace of his literary production, however, did not slacken. Moreover, his writing gained in depth and scope from an exposure to modernistic trends, particularly those of contemporary Russian &#x201c;Silver Age&#x201d; literature. Sholem Aleichem reassessed his views of men, women, and children and felt free to expose undercurrents of egotism, frustrated sexuality, and nihilism in his characters&#x2019; behavior. He also reassessed his earlier liberal and Zionist ideals and concluded that Jewish existence depended on making a shift from an idealistic eastern European culture to the materialism and hedonism he detected in the Jewish immigrant community in the United States. <i>Motl Peyse dem khazns</i> (<i>Motl the Cantor&#x2019;s Son</i>) was the masterpiece he produced during this phase of his development.</p><p>The outbreak of World War I caught him in Berlin as the subject of a hostile country; he thereupon managed, with great difficulties, to reach New York, where he attempted to resume his writing career. His health, however, was failing, and the bitter news that his son had succumbed to tuberculosis in Europe overwhelmed him. He died in May 1916 in New York, the most popular Yiddish writer ever. A large part of the eastern European Jewish community of the city came into the streets in a state of mourning comparable to that which would follow the death of Rudolph Valentino, the film star. Sholem Aleichem bequeathed to the Jewish world not only his literary works but also a universal recognition that the new American Jewish community was a resourceful sociopolitical entity with its own culture and a distinct role to play both in American affairs and in those of world Jewry.</p><p>WHO WOULD WANT TO LISTEN TO TEVYE?</p><p><i>I will speak, that I may find relief; I will open my lips and answer.</i></p><p><i>&#x2014;JOB 32:20</i></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>For over a century <i>Tevye der milkhiker</i> (<i>Tevye the Dairyman</i>) has been universally acknowledged as Sholem Aleichem&#x2019;s masterpiece. Endowed with a deep humanity, a delicate equilibrium between tragedy and comedy, and a vivacious comic narration, <i>Tevye</i> soars above the author&#x2019;s other achievements, brilliant as they are. Its vitality is such that it has survived a score of translations of uneven quality and questionable fidelity; various stage adaptations (including one prepared by the author himself), which for ideological or commercial considerations wrenched the story&#x2019;s heart out of its ribcage, crudely transmuting and obfuscating its meaning; and even a successful stage version as one of Broadway&#x2019;s schmaltziest musicals, <i>Fiddler on the Roof,</i> which superimposed upon the popular imagination a Tevye figure&#x2014;a diluted, semi-Judaized Zorba&#x2014;that tenuously, if not accidentally, resembles Sholem Aleichem&#x2019;s original creation no more than a beautified postcard resembles the reality of a foreign city. To withstand all this treatment, a work of art has to possess a formidable inner strength. Our task here is to point to the sources of that strength.</p><p>In the last century scholars and critics dwelled mainly on <i>Tevye</i>&#x2019;s social and cultural implications or on the character of Tevye and his symbolic or archetypal significance. Both topics are, of course, of considerable importance, but neither yields a full understanding of the work&#x2019;s unique qualities.</p><p>Its social and cultural significance is far-reaching. A historical panorama, the unfolding of which would normally necessitate the writing of a cycle of voluminous novels, is here squeezed into eight short novellas. The affairs of a provincial dairyman and the fortunes of his daughters become prisms that refract much of what is essential in the history of the Jews in the czarist empire during the last two turbulent decades of its existence. Because the eight tales were written intermittently, in each one the author was in a position to look at a different aspect of progressively endangered Jews living amid a hostile non-Jewish population and under a hostile autocratic regime. Starting with the rustic mock-idyll of Tevye&#x2019;s &#x201c;miraculous&#x201d; deliverance from penury, the tales gradually shed light on wider historical arenas, pointing to realities that loom far beyond the protagonist&#x2019;s provincial circumference: the revolutionary mood that swept the czarist empire in the first years of the twentieth century; the pogroms triggered by the failed 1905 revoluti...</p></p><h2>Endurance Diet</h2><p>Sports Nutritionist Matt Fitzgerald has spent nearly twenty years studying the diets of top professional endurance athletes, who are among the fittest and healthiest people in the world.

Syntax, the relationship of words to one another, forms, together with morphology, the material of grammar. Its relative importance varies according to the language considered. This is particularly true of word order, for when an inflected language loses its case endings, word order assumes many of the functions of the former cases. This outline by Professor Williams re-emphasizes the significance of word order in Hebrew. Developed over fifteen years in a formal course on Hebrew syntax at the University of Toronto, it treats the syntax of the noun, the verb, particles and clauses, with a selection of illustrative examples. Its contents are based on classical Hebrew prose, but some account is also taken of the deviations in later prose and poetry. In this new edition English translations have been provided for all Hebrew phrases and sentences, and the bibliography has been expanded.</p></p><p><b>John C.

In this volume, first published in 1979, Krenov invites the reader into his workshop, where he shares his techniques and uncompromising approach to craftsmanship, along with thoughts about his work and its place in the world. Photo sequences show how Krenov composes a cabinet directly in the wood, without dimensioned drawings. He also discusses working with shop-sawn veneers, the technique of fitting curved doors, and the problems of accuracy and mistakes. The book concludes with a detailed exploration of three furniture projects: a curved showcase cabinet, a writing table with drawer, and a chess table.</p><p>James Krenov studied furniture making and design with Carl Malmsten in Stockholm, Sweden, and later opened his own workshops there. In 1980 he returned to the United States to start and lead the fine-woodworking program at the College of the Redwoods, in Fort Bragg, California.

What remains when you take all the matter away? Can empty space--"nothing"--exist? To answer these questions, eminent scientist Frank Close takes us on a lively and accessible journey that ranges from ancient ideas and cultural superstitions to the frontiers of current research, illuminating the story of how scientists have explored the void and the rich discoveries they have made there. Readers will find an enlightening history of the vacuum: how the efforts to make a better vacuum led to the discovery of the electron; the ideas of Newton, Mach, and Einstein on the nature of space and time; the mysterious aether and how Einstein did away with it; and the latest ideas that the vacuum is filled with the Higgs field. The story ranges from the absolute zero of temperature and the seething vacuum of virtual particles and anti-particles that fills space, to the extreme heat and energy of the early universe.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions </strong>offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics.

The notion of woman as the Devil's accomplice is prominent throughout Christian history and has been used to legitimize the subordination of wives and daughters. In the nineteenth century, rebellious females performed counter-readings of this misogynist tradition. Lucifer was reconceptualized as a feminist liberator of womankind, and Eve became a heroine. In these reimaginings, Satan is an ally in the struggle against a tyrannical patriarchy supported by God the Father and his male priests. Per Faxneld shows how this Satanic feminism was expressed in a wide variety of nineteenth-century literary texts, autobiographies, pamphlets, newspaper articles, paintings, sculptures, and even artifacts of consumer culture like jewelry. He details how colorful figures like the suffragette Elizabeth Cady Stanton, gender-bending Theosophist H. P. Blavatsky, author Aino Kallas, actress Sarah Bernhardt, anti-clerical witch enthusiast Matilda Joslyn Gage, decadent marchioness Luisa Casati, and the Luciferian lesbian poetess Ren�e Vivien embraced these reimaginings. By exploring the connections between esotericism, literature, art and the political realm, <em>Satanic Feminism</em> sheds new light on neglected aspects of the intellectual history of feminism, Satanism, and revisionary mythmaking.<br></p><p><br><strong>Per Faxneld</strong> obtained his PhD in the History of Religions at Stockholm University in 2014. He was a visiting scholar at Cambridge University in 2015, and is currently a post-doctoral fellow at Mid-Sweden University. He is the author of two monographs on the history of Satanism and has published more than 30 peer-reviewed articles and book chapters on various matters related to Western esotericism.<br><br>"<em>Satanic Feminism</em> is strongly recommended to all those interested in understanding the crucial role of Satan in theWestern cultural imagination. ... The author does not restrict himself to a specific focus on Satanism, but interconnects several fields of study, including Western esoteric studies. ... Faxneld's volume goes far beyond prior works on the history of <em>intellectual Satanism</em>." -- Michele Olzi, <em>Aries</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Anatomy Lessons From the Great Masters</h2><p>This classic book, whose foremost author was one of the great artistic anatomy teachers of the twentieth century, is an invaluable instructor and reference guide for any professional, amateur, or student artist who depicts the human form. <br><br>Revealing the drawing principles behind one hundred inspiring masterpieces, the book presents work by Leonardo, Michelangelo, Rubens, Raphael, Titian, Rembrandt, and other greats. These superb portrayers of figures knew that the secret of drawing them was seeing how underlying bone and muscle structures mold the body&#x2019;s surface forms. Readers are shown how to learn from these great examples as the authors guide them through all the steps they would take in a life class or studio working with live models.</p><p><i>Anatomy Lessons from the Great Masters</i> provides an anatomical counterpart to Robert Beverly Hale's classic reference book, <i>Drawing Lessons from the Great Masters</i>. Terence Coyle, who for several years assisted Hale at the Art Students League of New York, kept detailed notes of Hale's lectures and teaching methods. He combined these notes with 100 drawings to illustrate how the great masters portrayed specific parts of the human physique. As Hale points out, master artists such as Rembrandt, Leonardo, and Raphael "absorbed the technical details of anatomy so well that these details could be set down instinctively.... If an artist has to occupy his mind with the task of clumsily grouping the elemental facts of anatomy as he draws, there can be little room left for really important matters--such as the spirit of the drawing and the artist's expressive intent." Coyle provides several examples within the study of each anatomical area to illustrate the variety of styles and methods employed by the masters. The book treats, in order, the rib cage, the pelvis and thigh, the knee and lower leg, the foot, the shoulder girdle, the arm, the hand, and the neck and head. A complete series of anatomical reference plates by Dr. Paul Richer is included. By applying the timeless anatomical principles the great masters have handed down to us, any artist can begin to acquire the means by which to express the "really important matters." <i>--Mary Ribesky</i><b>Robert Beverly Hale</b> was America&#x2019;s best-known teacher of figure/anatomy drawing during his long years as an instructor at the Art Students League and other fine institutions.

From James M. Cain's hard-nosed observation that "writing a novel is like working on foreign policy. There are problems to be solved. It's not all inspirational," to Joan Didion's account of how she composes a book--"I constantly retype my own sentences. Every day I go back to page one and just retype what I have. It gets me into a rhythm"--<i>The Paris Review</i> has elicited some of the most revelatory and revealing thoughts from the literary masters of our age. For more than half a century, the magazine has spoken with most of our leading novelists, poets, and playwrights, and the interviews themselves have come to be recognized as classic works of literature, an essential and definitive record of the writing life. They have won the coveted George Polk Award and have been a contender for the Pulitzer Prize. Now, <i>Paris Review</i> editor Philip Gourevitch introduces an entirely original selection of sixteen of the most celebrated interviews. Often startling, always engaging, these encounters contain an immense scope of intelligence, personality, experience, and wit from the likes of Elizabeth Bishop, Ernest Hemingway, Truman Capote, Rebecca West, and Billy Wilder. This is an indispensable book for all writers and readers.</p></p><p><p><b><i>The Paris Review</i></b> was founded in 1953 and has published early and important work by Philip Roth, V. S. Naipaul, Jeffrey Eugenides, A. S. Byatt, T. C. Boyle, William T. Vollmann, and many other writers who have given us the great literature of the past half century. Some of the magazine's greatest hits have been collected by Picador in <i>The Paris Review Book of People with Problems</i> as well as <i>The Paris Review Book for Planes, Trains, Elevators, and Waiting Rooms</i> and <i>The Paris Review Book of Heartbreak, Madness, Sex, Love, Betrayal, Outsiders, Intoxication, War, Whimsy, Horrors, God, Death, Dinner, Baseball, Travels, the Art of Writing, and Everything Else in the World Since 1953</i>.</p><p><b>Philip Gourevitch</b> is the editor of <i>The Paris Review,</i> a staff writer for <i>The New Yorker,</i> and the author of <i>A Cold Case</i> and <i>We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed with Our Families: Stories from Rwanda,</i> winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award.</p><p>&#x201c;The Paris Review books should be given out at dinner parties, readings, riots, weddings, galas -- shindigs of every shape. And they're perfect for the classroom too, from high schools all the way to MFA programs. In fact, I run a whole semester-long creative writing class based on the interviews. How else would I get the world's greatest living writers, living and dead, to come into the classroom with their words of wisdom, folly and fury? These books are wonderful, provocative, indispensible.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Colum McCann, novelist and Hunter College professor</i></p><p>&#x201c;I have all the copies of <i>The Paris Review</i> and like the interviews very much.

This stellar collection of them is as good a place as any to start.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>John Ashbery</i></p><p>&#x201c;I have been fascinated by the <i>Paris Review</i> interviews for as long as I can remember.

A party of 35 enemy scouts had been spotted roughly seven miles away, camped out in a rocky ravine. What would the young lieutenant colonel decide to do?<br><br>The pressure was on, and he knew it. After all, this was a time of war, and he alone was responsible for the 159 recruits he&#x2019;d led into the field. Despite the fact that the colonel was a 22-�year-�old rookie with zero combat experience, he&#x2019;d somehow found himself second in command of an entire army. Not only did he have to act quickly and decisively, he needed to prove himself to everyone who was watching. This would be a crucial test of his military prowess, but he had no doubt he would ace it. The supremely self-�assured young man was just itching to show his superiors what he was made of.<br><br>Those men in the ravine? They were clearly planning to attack, he confidently (and, as it turned out, inaccurately) concluded. So the colonel ordered a sneak assault. In the early hours of May 28, his troops descended on the unsuspecting party, who didn&#x2019;t stand a chance. In less than 15 minutes, 13 enemy soldiers were dead and 21 were �captured.<br><br>Brimming with pride over his victory, the colonel returned to camp and began firing off letters. The first was to his commander. But before even recounting news of the battle, the emboldened leader took the opportunity&#x2014;�in the form of an eight-�paragraph diatribe&#x2014;�to grouse about his pay. His next letter was to his younger brother, to whom he nonchalantly bragged about his fearlessness in the face of enemy attack: &#x201c;I can with truth assure you,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;I heard the bullets whistle and believe me there was something charming in the sound.&#x201d;<br><br>His self-�congratulatory correspondences completed, it was time to plan his next move. Convinced that the enemy was about to launch a revenge attack, he realized he would need to find a better location for their camp. After crossing a nearby mountain range, the colonel and his men found themselves in a large, low-�lying alpine meadow. The grassland was surrounded on all sides by rolling hills dotted with bushes and a dense pine forest. Surveying the area, the colonel declared it the perfect defensive location and ordered his troops to begin preparations.<br><br>A few days later, he looked on proudly as his men put the finishing touches on their circular stockade, which consisted of scores of upright seven-�foot logs draped with animal skins. And because it could hold only 70 men at once, he&#x2019;d ordered them to dig a three-�foot trench for everyone else to crouch in. The colonel thought it was marvelous, assuring his commander that &#x201c;we have with nature&#x2019;s assistance made a good entrenchment and by clearing the bushes out of these meadows prepared a charming field for an encounter.&#x201d; He knew they&#x2019;d be outmanned, but &#x201c;even with my small numbers,&#x201d; he reported, &#x201c;I shall not fear the attack of 500 men.&#x201d;<br><br>Unfortunately, not everyone agreed with the confident young leader. One of his many questionable decisions was the placement of the fort. Because it was built on such soft ground, a light shower of rain would turn the meadow into a swamp, and a downpour would flood the trenches and drench their ammunition. What&#x2019;s more, they were so close to the woods&#x2014;�just 60 yards away&#x2014;�that enemy marksmen could sneak up undetected and effortlessly fire on their fortress at close range. As for the fort itself, the colonel&#x2019;s allied commander&#x2014;�a seasoned battle veteran&#x2014;�insisted that &#x201c;that little thing upon the meadow&#x201d; simply would not hold.<br><br>Undeterred and convinced that he knew best, the colonel dismissed these arguments out of hand, furiously proclaiming the commander and his army to be &#x201c;treacherous devils&#x201d; and &#x201c;spies.&#x201d; A minor rebellion followed, with the allied commander and his followers fleeing in fear (incidentally, this fear turned out to be extremely well founded). In the battle that was to come, the colonel wouldn&#x2019;t find the bullets whistling past him to be quite as charming.<br><br>And that battle would be momentous. So momentous that the colonel&#x2019;s mistakes would change the course of history. In the years since, historians have attempted to explain how the operation went so tragically wrong. Many have appropriately criticized the colonel for &#x201c;advancing when he should have retreated; for fighting without awaiting sufficient reinforcements; for picking an indefensible spot; for the slapdash construction of the fort; for alienating his . . . allies; and for shocking hubris in thinking that he could defeat the imposing [enemy] force.&#x201d;<br><br>But the colonel&#x2019;s downfall can&#x2019;t be attributed simply to tactical errors, flawed maneuvers, or the lost trust of his men. Examining them alone overlooks their root cause: at the most basic level, the colonel lacked the single most important, and yet least examined, determinant of success or failure&#x2014;�whether on the battlefield, in the workplace, or anywhere else. That quality is self-�awareness.<br><br>While a precise definition is more complex than it first seems, self-�awareness is, at its core, the ability to see ourselves clearly&#x2014;�to understand who we are, how others see us, and how we fit into the world around us. And since Plato instructed us to &#x201c;know thyself,&#x201d; philosophers and scientists alike have extolled the virtues of self-�awareness. Indeed, this ability is arguably one of the most remarkable aspects of being human. In his book The Telltale Brain, neuroscientist V. S. Ramachandran poetically explains:<br><br>Any ape can reach for a banana, but only humans can reach for the stars. Apes live, contend, breed and die in forests&#x2014;�end of story. Humans write, investigate, and quest. We splice genes, split atoms, launch rockets. We peer upward . . . and delve deeply into the digits of pi. Perhaps most remarkably of all, we gaze inward, piecing together the puzzle of our own unique and marvelous brain . . . This, truly, is the greatest mystery of all.&#x201d;<br><br>Some have even argued that the ability to understand ourselves is at the core of human survival and advancement. For millions of years, the ancestors of Homo sapiens evolved almost painfully slowly. But, as Ramachandran explains, about 150,000 years ago, there was a rather explosive development in the human brain&#x2014;�where, among other things, we gained the ability to examine our own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, as well as to see things from others&#x2019; points of view (as we will learn, both of these processes are absolutely critical for self-�awareness). Not only did this create the foundation for higher forms of human expression&#x2014;�like art, spiritual practices, and language&#x2014;�it came with a survival advantage for our ancestors, who had to work together to stay alive. Being able to evaluate their behaviors and decisions and read their impact on other members of the tribe helped them, to use a slightly more modern reference, not to get voted off the island.<br><br>Flash forward to the twenty-�first century. Though we may not face the same day-�to-�day threats to our existence as our ancestors did, self-�awareness is no less necessary to our survival and success&#x2014;�at work, in our relationships, and in life. There is strong scientific evidence that people who know themselves and how others see them are happier. They make smarter decisions. They have better personal and professional relationships. They raise more mature children. They&#x2019;re smarter, superior students who choose better careers. They&#x2019;re more creative, more confident, and better communicators. They&#x2019;re less aggressive and less likely to lie, cheat, and steal. They&#x2019;re better performers at work who get more promotions. They&#x2019;re more effective leaders with more enthusiastic employees. They even lead more profitable companies.<br><br>On the flip side, a lack of self-�awareness can be risky at best and disastrous at worst. In business, regardless of what we do or what stage we&#x2019;re at in our careers, our success depends on understanding who we are and how we come across to our bosses, clients, customers, employees, and peers. This becomes even more important the higher you ascend on the corporate ladder: senior executives who lack self-�awareness are 600 percent more likely to derail (which can cost companies a staggering $50 million per executive). And more generally, un-�self-�aware professionals don&#x2019;t just feel less fulfilled in their careers&#x2014;�when they get stuck, they tend to have trouble figuring out what their next phase should even be.<br><br>The list goes on and on. After so many years of researching the subject, I would go so far as to say that self-�awareness is the meta-�skill of the twenty-�first century. As you&#x2019;ll read in the pages ahead, the qualities most critical for business and leadership success today&#x2014;�things like emotional intelligence, empathy, influence, persuasion, communication, and collaboration&#x2014;�all stem from self-�awareness. To put it another way, if we&#x2019;re not self-�aware, it&#x2019;s almost impossible to master the skills that make us stronger team players, superior leaders, and better relationship builders&#x2014;�at work and beyond.<br><br>Now, you&#x2019;d certainly be hard pressed to find many people who don&#x2019;t instinctively know that self-�awareness is important. After all, it&#x2019;s a term we tend to toss around freely&#x2014;�about our boss, our colleagues, our in-�laws, our politicians&#x2014;�although have you noticed that when we do, it&#x2019;s usually in the negative, as in &#x201c;so-�and-�so just isn&#x2019;t self-�aware?&#x201d; But in today&#x2019;s world, despite the critical role it plays in our success and happiness, self-�awareness is a remarkably rare quality.<br><br>For most people, it&#x2019;s easier to choose self-�delusion&#x2014;�the antithesis of self-�awareness&#x2014;�over the cold, hard truth. This is particularly true when our delusion masquerades, as it often does, as insight. The colonel is one example. Let&#x2019;s look at a more modern manifestation. I recently picked up Travis Bradberry&#x2019;s best-�selling book Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and I was astonished to learn that over the last decade, our collective emotional intelligence (EQ) has improved. (EQ is defined as the ability to detect, understand, and manage emotions in ourselves and others, and countless studies have shown that people who have it are more successful, more resilient in the face of obstacles, more tolerant of stress, better at building relationships, and more.) But in my work as an organizational psychologist, Bradberry&#x2019;s findings didn&#x2019;t match what I had observed: at least anecdotally, I&#x2019;ve seen low EQ becoming more, not less, of a problem in recent years.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t until I took the online assessment that came with the book that I identified the stunning source of the discrepancy. While, yes, Bradberry&#x2019;s research involved a staggering 500,000 people, his conclusions were based on their own self-�assessments. Think about that for a minute. Picture a few of the least emotionally intelligent people you know. If you asked them to evaluate their own EQ, how much would you bet that they&#x2019;d see themselves as at least above average? So an alternative, and far more likely, explanation for Bradbury&#x2019;s findings is a growing gap between how we see ourselves and what we really are. In other words, what looked like an increase in EQ was more likely a decrease in self-�awareness.<br><br>Our increasingly &#x201c;me&#x201d;-�focused society makes it even easier to fall into this trap. Recent generations have grown up in a world obsessed with self-�esteem, constantly being reminded of their wonderful and special qualities. It&#x2019;s far more tempting to see ourselves through rose-�colored glasses than to objectively examine who we are and how we&#x2019;re seen. And this isn&#x2019;t just a generational problem, or even just an American one&#x2014;�it afflicts people of all ages, genders, backgrounds, cultures, and creeds.<br><br>Right now, you might be mentally conjuring all the delusional people you know and chuckling&#x2014;�the co-�worker who thinks he&#x2019;s a brilliant presenter but puts everyone to sleep in meetings; the boss who brags about being approachable but terrifies her team; the friend who thinks she&#x2019;s a &#x201c;people person&#x201d; but is always the most awkward guest at the party. Yet there&#x2019;s something else we all need to consider. As the Bible asks, &#x201c;How can you say to your brother, &#x2018;Let me take the speck out of your eye,&#x2019; when all the time there is a plank in your own eye?&#x201d; (Matthew 7:4). Whether it&#x2019;s at work, at home, at school, or at play, we&#x2019;re quick to accuse others of being unaware, but we rarely (if ever) ask ourselves whether we have the same problem. Case in point: in a survey that I conducted among potential readers of this very book, a full 95 percent reported that they were either somewhat or very self-�aware!<br><br>The truth is that while most of us think we know ourselves pretty well, this confidence is often unfounded. Researchers have established that our self-�assessments &#x201c;are often flawed in substantive and systematic ways.&#x201d; As you&#x2019;ll read more about soon, studies show that we tend to be terrible judges of our own performance and abilities&#x2014;�from our leadership skills to our car-�driving prowess to our performance at school and at work. The scariest part? The least competent people are usually the most confident in their abilities.<br><br>And in most cases, the planks in our eyes are pretty obvious to everyone but us. A tone-�deaf college student who drops out of school to become a singer. A braggadocios boss who reads scores of business books but remains a terrible leader. A parent who spends very little time with his kids but thinks he&#x2019;s &#x201c;Dad of the Year.&#x201d; A thrice-�divorced woman who&#x2019;s convinced that the end of each marriage was her ex&#x2019;s fault. Or a colonel who thinks he&#x2019;s a military genius but is really about to get in way over his head.<br><br>But being overconfident about our abilities isn&#x2019;t the only way that low self-�awareness can play out. Sometimes we lack clarity about our values and goals, causing us to perpetually make choices that aren&#x2019;t in our best interests. Other times, we fail to grasp the impact we&#x2019;re having on the people around us, alienating our colleagues, friends, and families without even knowing it.</p><h2>A Man of the People</h2><p><b>From the renowned author of The African Trilogy, a political satire about an unnamed African country navigating a path between violence and corruption</b><br> &nbsp;<br> As Minister for Culture, former school teacher M. A. Nanga is a man of the people, as cynical as he is charming, and a roguish opportunist. When Odili, an idealistic young teacher, visits his former instructor at the ministry, the division between them is vast. But in the eat-and-let-eat atmosphere, Odili's idealism soon collides with his lusts&#x2014;and the two men's personal and political tauntings threaten to send their country into chaos. When Odili launches a vicious campaign against his former mentor for the same seat in an election, their mutual animosity drives the country to revolution.<br> &nbsp;<br> Published, prophetically, just days before Nigeria's first attempted coup in 1966,&nbsp;<i>A Man of the People</i>&nbsp;is an essential part of Achebe&#x2019;s body of work.</p><p>By the renowned author of <i>Things Fall Apart</i>, this novel foreshadows the Nigerian coups of 1966 and shows the color and vivacity as well as the violence and corruption of a society making its own way between the two worlds.<b>Chinua Achebe&nbsp;</b>(1930&#x2013;2013)<b>&nbsp;</b>was born in Nigeria.

Introduction by Barry N. Malzberg. Dustjacket art by Bob Eggleton.</p><p>The Fifteenth book in the NESFA&#x2019;s Choice Series.One of the most durable writers of sf's golden age, Brown (1906-72) was a stalwart of the pulps, the cheap-paper magazines that published most genre fiction from the late '20s to the '60s. He contributed uniquely by virtue of also being a crackerjack mystery writer, for he brought the noirish atmosphere and seedy details of the era's crime fiction to sf. He also brought the sardonic humor of the newsrooms in which he learned the writing trade, and that was his finest gift. A Brown story typically takes an odd situation, develops it risibly, eerily, or suspensefully enough, and concludes with a surprise calculated to rouse chuckles, chills, or both. Famous characters from his stories include Mitkey, an ordinary mouse who becomes an interstellar explorer, and the last man on Earth, who hears a knock on his door. To read very many of his stories is to be convinced, rightly or wrongly, that Brown's manner and modus inspired such early TV shows as <i>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</i> and <i>The Twilight Zone</i>. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She has also authored many articles on the people and places of the American West. Her work has won national and regional awards. Her first John O'Malley mystery, <b>The Eagle Catcher</b>, was a national bestseller, garnering excellent reviews from the <b>Denver Post</b>, Tony Hillerman, Jean Hager, Loren D. Estleman, Stephen White, Earlene Fowler, Ann Ripley and other top writers in the field. A native of Colorado, she resides in Boulder.Father John Aloysius O'Malley is a Jesuit priest on an Arapaho reservation. John had wanted to teach college or University but after falling to alcohol and recovering he found it impossible to find an institution that wanted him. That is how he ended up on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming trying to redeem himself. Helping him out for the last two weeks is Father Joseph Keenan, who should be retired (he is seventy-two with a serious heart condition) but who has instead returned to the reservation where he had been a pastor in the 1960s. The mission gets a phone call that someone is dying and needs the last rites performed. Joseph takes John's truck and heads out to the house even though John argues that he should take the call and allow the older man to rest. Joseph is shot getting out of the truck. Was he the intended victim or John? Vicky Holden is a lawyer who, as well as trying to help figure out this mystery, is trying to help the popular movie star Sharon David to find her parents. Sharon was adopted and thinks that, although she has light skin, perhaps her biological parents were from this reservation. Vicky has trouble proving this for two reasons; 1) adoption to an outside family rarely occurred on the reservation and 2) the year that Sharon was born was the year that many babies died and therefore there would not have been any adoptions. Vicky and John who are friends come together to figure out these two mysteries and a few others that they stumble upon on their way. The Lost Bird was a great mystery, especially as events start to come to light. It was a book where you had to figure out who and why as you read along. Margaret Coel did a great job of tying up a lot of loose ends in a logical, exciting and enjoyable manner. You end up feeling a lot of empathy for the characters and their situations. Pick this one up, you'll enjoy it. The Lost Bird is an engrossing mystery and a great read! Margaret Coel manages to have enjoyable characters and a super mystery - not an easy task.

Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German Lutheran pastor who was executed by the Nazis in 1945, constantly wrote about these themes, and made better sense of them for 20th-century Christians than almost anyone else. <i>Meditations on the Cross</i>, edited by Manfred Weber, collects his letters and sermons on the vexing topic of Christ's Passion. Each chapter is brief, focused, uplifting, and devastating, like any good devotional should be.The cross and resurrection, suffering, and overcoming death were central themes in Dietrich Bonhoeffer&#39;s theological work. Throughout his life, he focused on these themes, trying to disclose their relevance for human life and actions and to answer the question &#34;What does it mean to be a Christian?&#34; These letters and sermons contain Bonhoeffer&#39;s personal and faithful word about the crucifixion and the power of the cross for all Christian disciples.

I&#x2019;ve found that the best way to get that is to have a daily gratitude practice.<br> So every morning when I open my eyes, and before my feet touch the ground, I thank God for the gift of my life.

So it&#x2019;s worth seeking out people who are like this and asking them how they stay that way: their practices, their principles, and how they put those into action.<br><br> The power of gratitude can turn a bad day into a good one. It reboots your spirit. It makes you look at your life in a different way. Being thankful can make all the difference in your day.<br> So start your very own daily gratitude practice.

With 40 per cent new material in the form of new hands-on demonstrations, examples of her work and extended text, Jean provides a valuable insight into the materials and techniques she uses to inject colour and light into her stunningly beautiful, award-winning watercolour paintings. <br><br> Jean's enthusiasm and passion for art is evident throughout the book, which is packed full of ideas, useful tips, expert advice and over 20 step-by-step demonstrations. with subjects ranging from atmospheric winter landscapes to bright colourful cockerels, all painted in Jean's loose and expressive style, artists of all tastes and abilities will not fail to be inspired by her imaginative and exciting use of light and colour.</p><p>A member of the Society for Women Artists (SWA), international watercolourist Jean Haines is well-known for her love of her chosen medium. Having lived and travelled in many countries, this popular artist has had the opportunity to develop her skills whilst under the influence of masters from many countries, including Asia, the Middle East and Europe. She studied brush control while living in China and this had the greatest impact on her style. Later, when working with artists from India and Pakistan, she became inspired by the vibrant colours they used. The combination of East meets West in Jeans style is to be enjoyed. The magical free flow of water and colour straight on to a blank working surface (with no initial drawing) creates amazing results, often leaving her audience breathless with delight. Her paintings can be found in homes all over the world and in 2009 she won the Anthony J Lester Award during the SWA Annual Exhibition, where her work was likened to Joseph Crawhalls of the famous Glasgow Boys group of artists. She regularly writes for art magazines and exhibits in a number of galleries. Her hugely successful workshops are held regularly in the UK, and in 2014 she visited Australia for a Book Signing and Workshop Tour. In 2015 she will be visiting California, New York and St Louis in the USA to hold workshops and launch her new book &#39;Jean Haines&#39; Watercolour World&#39;. Jean lives in Crookham Village, Hampshire.Well, this is a first! I&#39;ve seen books dragged out of well-deserved retirement, kept current by revamped covers and re-issued as &#34;classics&#34;, but I&#39;ve never seen one given a complete makeover that doubles the original extent. I had reservations about this when it first appeared. It&#39;s not that it wasn&#39;t good, or that I didn&#39;t like it, just that I didn&#39;t feel that Jean&#39;s loose and somewhat idiosyncratic style fitted comfortably into a series of what were largely technical manuals. All that clearly didn&#39;t harm sales and Jean has, of course, gone on to become a bestselling and highly respected author. Later volumes have given her work the freedom it needs and it&#39;s blossomed as a result. Re-workings of what for the moment we&#39;ll call juvenilia are rarely successful. Authors move on, their style develops and things that are largely historical are best left as pieces of history. If that means they&#39;re a footnote, so be it. It&#39;s often better than being something everyone comes to regret and has to make excuses for later. And now, gentle reader, I&#39;m going to eat my words: both my previous reservations and my suspicion of the re-vamp. This is everything the book should have been in the first place. It hasn&#39;t been shoe-horned into a series format, for a start. Series are great and are often a way of introducing new authors who may not have the gravitas to stand alone, but can be carried on by the momentum a series provides and given a toe-hold in the water (yes, I do know that&#39;s a mixed metaphor, but it was kind of you to mention it). It&#39;s also been completely re-designed and there are vastly more illustrations. Now, it has room to spread its wings and to breathe, which is exactly what Jean&#39;s work needs. She&#39;s not about small illustrations that populate a detailed text, she&#39;s about illustrations, illustrations and illustrations. You need to see her work full-page and preferably on a crisp white background and that&#39;s what you have here. I haven&#39;t done a word-by-word comparison, but I&#39;m pretty sure this is the original text and it now becomes an adjunct to the pictures, rather than the other way round. The best art books usually lead on the paintings and use the text just as a caption to explain what you&#39;re looking at when you need a nudge or it isn&#39;t immediately obvious. This is a hard trick to pull off because, if the original book was any good, it&#39;ll have been properly put together and be a perfect sphere it&#39;s very hard to pull apart. No matter how much you want to, it is, as I&#39;ve hinted above, usually better to leave well alone and start something new from scratch. So, congratulations to Search Press, whose editorial and design teams are on a bit of a roll at the moment, and to Jean too. With this many new illustrations, she&#39;s had a pretty large part in the exercise as well. You need this book. * Artbookreview.net * I&#39;m not normally a fan of revised re-issues. Artists move on and what they wanted to say on a subject was pretty much perfectly formed at the time. Unpicking a thread and trying to make it into sommething else all to often lands up with a mess. But... and it&#39;s a very big but. Jean Haines and Search Press have done a superb job here. This was Jean&#39;s first book and it appeared in a beginner&#39;s series to which it and her style, were never really suited. Jean belongs to the broder canvas, as it were and her loose impressionistic style needs room to breathe. Basic instruction and 48 pages felt more like an eagle in a cage - you could see the potential, but not the spread of the wings. For this version which has enlarged the format and more than doubled the extent, there&#39;s been a complete redesign that&#39;s in keeping with the later books. The paper is bright white just like the original paintings and it shows the colour and its subtle tints, hues and washes much better. The larger paint size means that nothing&#39;s reduced down to where you can&#39;t see the brushwork. On top of that there&#39;s additional material and more demonstrations. This is no longer a book that hints at what might be possible, but one which celebrates Jean&#39;s work and what can be done if you&#39;re brave with watercolour. The result is a triumph and something you&#39;ll want even if you have the first version. * SAA Paint * The range of its capabilities, it shows in numerous illustrations, instructions and important advice on watercolours. We see exotic dressed people, foreign cityscapes, delicate flowers, fruits and animals repeatedly. But looking at the sun-drenched images, the indicated details, the harmony of color selection arouses enthusiasm. However, learning this particular style of painting requires fundamental knowledge. Painters who represent very realistically and in detail, will have difficulties with the implementation. The experimental artist, however, will have the courage to do so and the casual use of the brush is love, this technique can be learned easily. The prerequisite is to develop each chapter of the book. To better understand the painting Jean Haines shows detailed examples to brush selection and their handling. Many mixtures of their eleven favorite colors are presented, with which it has this book also painted most of the pictures. In the chapter &#34;light and how we see it&#34; it gives an insight into their distinctive way of representation of light and strong contrasts. Known techniques such as wet-on-wet, glazes, salt, negative painting, spraying technique, are demonstrated. But what good is the perfect mastery of basic skills, if in the end produced a boring image? Only the composition makes the picture into a unique and unusual artwork. From their many years of painting experience knows the artist that before painting the thinking is. First we have to decide what we want to paint. As the object is lively and compelling? What foreground and background should we choose? What colors cause a harmonious whole? How are the brush strokes are performed? Only after these preliminary we should start painting. In the penultimate chapter &#34;Summary&#34; shows Jean Haines progressive image formation on the example of two taps, a fleeing rabbit and a Seascape with boats. The detailed imaging that brief but informative texts and useful tips make Technique clearly and comprehensibly. What I personally have missed something, is the lack of photographic pictures. I would have been interested in whether the artist paints with no pictures or sketches and photos to help take the reaction of light and shadow, the search for interesting details not easy for me without visual aids. For the advanced experimental watercolourist looking for a loose style of painting, the book is recommended &#34;Colour and light&#34;. In der uberarbeiteten Neuauflage ihres Buches &#34;Colour and light&#34; widmet sich die Kunstlerin Jean Haines dem Thema &#34;Farbe und Licht&#34;. Die Bandbreite ihres Koennens zeigt sie in zahlreichen Abbildungen, Anleitungen und wichtigen Tipps zum Aquarellmalen.Die vielfaltigen Eindrucke ihrer Fernreisen lasst sie in ihre impressionistisch wirkenden Bilder einfliessen. Wir sehen exotische gekleidete Menschen, fremde Stadtansichten, zarte Blumen, Fruchte und immer wieder Tiere. * Kreative review * July 2016 This is a reissue of Jean&#39;s first book which originally appeared as part of a series aimed at beginners. It was never well suited to the format and length always made the artist&#39;s work feel constrained. A redeisnged and more than doubled extent have give it wings that are more in keeping with her later books. Extended re-issues do not work, authors move on a what they wanted to say on the subject in question was usually there in the original. Additions can feel at best bolted on or, at worst out-takes that should have stayed on the cutting room floor. This emphatically is not the case here. The original has promise and that has been realised now, the result being a triumph. * The Leisure Painter * Summer 2016, Issue 2 This is a new edition of Jean Haine&#39;s first and bestselling title.We have included it for people who want to go a little bit deeper into painting and learn more skills and techniques. Just like Paint Yourself Calm, this is also large format and full of colour. It&#39;s not intended for absolute beginners but there are certainly no concepts or requirements that make this impentrable to someone new to watercolour painting. * Cygnus Review *</p><h2>Bringing the Gospel Home: Witnessing to Family Members, Close Friends, and Others Who Know You Well</h2><p><p><strong>Jesus is off limits </strong>for a lot of families and friends&#x2015;or at least that&#x2019;s how it appears sometimes.

Mises defines <i>liberalism</i> as "the liberal doctrine of the harmony of the rightly understood interests of all members of a free society founded on the principle of private ownership of the means of production." This book presents the theoretical and practical arguments for liberalism in the classical tradition.<br><br>The foundation of liberalism, Mises says, rests on an understanding and appreciation of private property, social cooperation, the freedom idea, ethics and morality, democracy, and the legitimate role of government. Liberalism is not a political party; it is a system of social organization. The liberal program aims at securing equality under law and freedom of opportunity for everyone to make their own choices and decisions, so long as they do not interfere with the equal rights of others; it offers no special privileges to anyone. Under liberalism, the role of government would be limited to protecting the lives, property, and freedom of its citizens to pursue their own ends and goals. Mises is more specific here than elsewhere in applying the liberal program to economic policy, domestic and foreign. Also in this book, Mises contrasts liberalism with other conceivable systems of social organization such as socialism, communism, and fascism.<br><br><b>Ludwig von Mises</b> (1881&#x2013;1973)&nbsp;was the leading spokesman of the Austrian School of Economics throughout most of the twentieth century. He earned his doctorate in law and economics from the University of Vienna in 1906. In 1926, Mises founded the Austrian Institute for Business Cycle Research. From 1909 to 1934, he was an economist for the Vienna Chamber of Commerce. Before the <i>Anschluss</i>, in 1934 Mises left for Geneva, where he was a professor at the Graduate Institute of International Studies until 1940, when he emigrated to New York City. From 1948 to 1969, he was a visiting professor at New York University.<br><br><b>Bettina Bien Greaves</b>&nbsp;is a former resident scholar, trustee, and longtime staff member of the Foundation for Economic Education. She&nbsp;has written and lectured extensively on topics of free market economics. Her articles have appeared in such journals as <i>Human Events, Reason,</i> and <i>The Freeman: Ideas on Liberty.</i> A student of Mises, Greaves has become an expert on his work in particular and that of the Austrian School of economics in general. She has translated several Mises monographs, compiled an annotated bibliography of his work, and edited collections of papers by Mises and other members of the Austrian School.</p><p>Ludwig von Mises (1881-1973) was a preeminent philosopher and economist during the twentieth century. He shared an intellectual friendship with literary giant Ayn Rand, and his theorems and philosophies have continued to influence the careers and ideas of politicians and economists alike.</p><h2>French in Action: A Beginning Course in Language and Culture: The Capretz Method, Part 1 (English and French Edition)</h2><p><p>Since it was first published, <i>French in Action: A Beginning Course in Language and Culture&#x2015;The Capretz Method</i> has been widely recognized in the field as a model for video-based foreign-language instructional materials.

If so, you're not alone. Digital-age pundits warn that as our appetite for books dwindles, so too do the virtues in which printed, bound objects once trained us: the willpower to focus on a sustained argument, the curiosity to look beyond the day's news, the willingness to be alone. The shelves of the world's great libraries, though, tell a more complicated story. Examining the wear and tear on the books that they contain, English professor Leah Price finds scant evidence that a golden age of reading ever existed. From the dawn of mass literacy to the invention of the paperback, most readers already skimmed and multitasked. Print-era doctors even forbade the very same silent absorption now recommended as a cure for electronic addictions. The evidence that books are dying proves even scarcer. In encounters with librarians, booksellers and activists who are reinventing old ways of reading, Price offers fresh hope to bibliophiles and literature lovers alike.<br></p><p>Leah Price has taught English at Cambridge University, Harvard University, and Rutgers University, where from fall 2019 onward she will be founding director of the Rutgers Book Initiative. She is the author <i>How to Do Things with Books in Victorian Britain</i> and the editor of <i>Unpacking My Library</i>. <strong></strong>"[Price] is not an elegist for print: her extraordinary grasp of every development in book history, from incunabula to beach reads, monasteries to bookmobiles, suggests that a love of printed matter need not be a form of nostalgia...Her radiant descriptions of the physical properties of books, the forensic traces-from smudges to candle wax-of earlier bodies holding them, immediately sent me to the Internet..."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Dan Chiasson, <i>New Yorker </i></b></i></b><br><br>"Price's book-unlike other examples of what she calls 'autobibliography'-is funny and hopeful, rather than dour and pious...<i>What We Talk About When We Talk About Books</i> is an enjoyable tour, full of surprising byways into historical arcana."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Jennifer Szalai, <i>New York Times </i></b></i></b><br><br>"A witty, tonic rebuttal to the latest round of doomsday prognostications about the fate of literature."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Wall Street Journal </i></b></i></b><br><br><br>"Price's premise, that there truly was no golden age of reading that we should be trying to get back to, is presented with humor and charm...Those still worried that technology has spoiled their attention span shouldn't be."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Booklist</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Predictions of the death of the book weren't only greatly exaggerated; as Leah Price notes in <i>What We Talk About When We Talk About Books</i>, they were old news. The book has survived numerous death sentences in the past, and this time, as before, it's been the occasion to reinvent old practices of reading. What the Victorians called "furniture books" continue to adorn coffee tables and the Ikea shelves widened to accommodate them. People still hold books in their laps on couches and in coaches (enjoying the "library atmosphere" of Amtrak quiet cars). Self-help books have their roots the "bibliotherapy" proposed a century ago. It is still a very bookish world that we inhabit, and I know of no guide to it more witty and engaging than Leah Price, whose insights, erudition, and apercus had me dog-earing every other page."&#x2015;<b>Geoff Nunberg, resident linguist</b>, <b><i><b>NPR's <i>Fresh Air</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Eye-opening and filled with delightful nuggets of truth, <i>What We Talk About When We Talk About Books</i> offers no nostalgia for a more tranquil reading past but rather a hopeful glimpse into an essential reading future."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>BookPage</b></i></i></b><br><br>"A deeply researched and deeply fun-to-read reassurance that there is still hope for books-and that there always has been."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Shelf Awareness </b></i></i></b><br><br>"Price combines a lighthearted romp through literary history with a serious intent: to argue that the rise of e-texts is not the radical change often claimed...Provides welcome comfort that the beloved book is in good shape, regardless of the form it ultimately takes."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Publishers Weekly </i></b></i></b><br><br>"Books are not dead.

His narrator, Arno Strine, is a 35-year-old office temp who is writing his autobiography. "It's harder than I thought!" he admits. His "Fold-powers" are easier; he can stop the world and use it as his own pleasure ground. Arno uses this gift not for evil or material gain (he would feel guilty about stealing), though he does undress a good number of women and momentarily place them in compromising positions--always, in his view, with respect and love. Anyone who can stop time and refer in self-delight to his "chronanisms" can't be all bad! Like Baker's other books, <i>The Fermata</i> gains little from synopsis. The pleasure is literally in the text. What's memorable is less the sex and the sex toys (including the "Monasticon," in the shape of a monk holding a vibrating manuscript) than Arno's wistful recollections of intimacy: the noise, for instance, of his ex-girlfriend's nail clipper, "which I listened to in bed as some listen to real birdsong."Nicholson Baker has published five novels&#x2013;<b>The Mezzanine</b>, <b>Room Temperature</b>, <b>Vox</b>, <b>The Fermata</b>, and <b>The Everlasting Story of Nory</b>&#x2013;and two works of nonfiction, <b>U and I</b> and <b>The Size of Thoughts</b>.

By gathering essays that exemplify the new thinking about matter and processes of materialization, this important collection shows how scholars are reworking older materialist traditions, contemporary theoretical debates, and advances in scientific knowledge to address pressing ethical and political challenges. In the introduction, Diana Coole and Samantha Frost highlight common themes among the distinctive critical projects that comprise the new materialisms. The continuities they discern include a posthumanist conception of matter as lively or exhibiting agency, and a reengagement with both the material realities of everyday life and broader geopolitical and socioeconomic structures. <p></p><p>Coole and Frost argue that contemporary economic, environmental, geopolitical, and technological developments demand new accounts of nature, agency, and social and political relationships; modes of inquiry that privilege consciousness and subjectivity are not adequate to the task. New materialist philosophies are needed to do justice to the complexities of twenty-first-century biopolitics and political economy, because they raise fundamental questions about the place of embodied humans in a material world and the ways that we produce, reproduce, and consume our material environment. </p><p><br>Contributors<br>Sara Ahmed<br>Jane Bennett<br>Rosi Braidotti<br>Pheng Cheah<br>Rey Chow<br>William E.

Daniel Kirk's delightful story (Abrams, 2012) about two mice friends exploring a museum is almost wholly dependent on Kirk's wonderful illustrations for meaning. Chris Sorensen's narration is serviceable, but the production would have benefited from some introductory music or sound effects. This museum adventure makes an ideal listen/read before a unit on journaling or a visit to an art or history museum. Library Mouse, Sam, who is a writer, and his friend, Sarah, an explorer, see marvelous examples of Ancient Egyptian artifacts, knights in shining armor, and a panoply of famous paintings (art details can be accessed at http://www.abramsbooks.com/librarymouse/LibraryMouse_Guide_FINAL.pdf). Along the way, they meet a mysterious, if initially frightening, fellow artist who admires their work. Students will be inspired to bring along their own journals on museum field trips to record their sketches and write about what they see. Librarians, art teachers, and classroom teachers will find the colorful picture book a stimulating and useful tool for their lessons, so make sure it is always available along with the audio version.-Lonna Pierce, MacArthur Elementary School, Binghamton, NY&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

When he finally gets to the office, the inspector learns about a strange abduction: a woman was abducted, drugged, and then released unharmed only hours later. Within a few days, the same thing happens again. Both women are thirty years old and work in a bank.&nbsp;<br><br>Montalbano also has to deal with an arson case. A shop has burned down, and its owner, Marcello Di Carlo, seems to have vanished into thin air. At first this seems like a trivial case, but a third abduction&#x2014;yet again of a girl who works in a bank&#x2014;and the discovery of a body bring up new questions.</p><p><b>Andrea Camilleri</b>, a mega-bestseller in Italy and Germany, is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Inspector Montalbano mystery series as well as historical novels that take place in nineteenth-century Sicily. His books have been made into Italian television shows and translated into thirty-two languages. His thirteenth Montalbano novel, <i>The Potter&#x2019;s Field</i>, won the Crime Writers&#x2019; Association International Dagger Award and was longlisted for the IMPAC Dublin Literary Award. <br><br> <b>Stephen Sartarelli</b> is an award-winning translator and the author of three books of poetry.At half past five that morning&#x2014;give or take a few minutes&#x2014; a fly that had long been stuck to the windowpane as though dead suddenly opened its wings, rubbed them together to clean them, then took flight and, a moment later, changed direction and landed on the bedside table.<br> There it kept still for a few seconds, taking stock of the situation, then shot away like a rocket, straight into the left nostril of the placidly sleeping Inspector Montalbano.<br> Without waking up, the inspector felt a bothersome itch in his nose and slapped himself hard in the face to make it go away. Since, in his groggy state of sleep, he hadn&#x2019;t gauged the force of the blow, it had two immediate results: One, it woke him up; and two, it smashed his nose so hard that it started to bleed.<br> He bolted out of bed, cursing the saints in rapid fire as the blood gushed out, dashed into the kitchen, opened the refrig- erator, grabbed two ice cubes, applied these to the bridge of his nose, and sat down, keeping his head bent back.<br> Five minutes later, the bleeding stopped.<br> He went into the bathroom, splashed some water on his face, neck, and chest, and then got back into bed.<br> He had barely closed his eyes when he felt the very same itch as before, except that this time it was in his right nostril. <br><br> Apparently the fly had decided to change its area of exploration.<br> How was he ever going to get rid of this tremendous pain in the ass?<br> Using his hand really wasn&#x2019;t the best idea, given the prior result.<br> He shook his head gently. Not only did the fly not move, it went farther inside.<br> Maybe if he scared it . . . &#x201c;Ahhhhh!&#x201d;<br> The yell left his ears ringing, but it achieved the desired result. The itch was gone.<br> He was finally starting to fall back asleep when he felt the fly again, this time walking on his forehead. Cursing the saints anew, he decided to try a new strategy.<br> Grabbing the sheet with both hands, he tugged it sharply, pulling it completely over his head. That way the fly wouldn&#x2019;t find so much as a millimeter of exposed flesh to walk on. The problem was that by shutting himself in like that, he cut off most of his air supply.<br> It was a very short-lived victory.<br> Less than a minute later, he distinctly felt the fly land on his lower lip.<br> It was clear the disgusting insect hadn&#x2019;t flown away but had remained under the sheet. He felt suddenly disheart- ened. He would never win his battle with the goddamn fly. &#x201c;A strong man knows when to admit defeat,&#x201d; he said to himself, getting out of bed in resignation and going into the bathroom.<br> After returning to his bedroom to get dressed, as he was about to take his trousers from the chair where he&#x2019;d left them, out of the corner of his eye he saw the fly on the bed- side table.<br> It was within reach, and he took advantage.<br> In a flash he raised his right hand and brought it down on the fly, crushing it so thoroughly that it remained stuck to the palm of his hand.<br> He went back into the bathroom and took a long time washing his hands, humming all the while and feeling sat- isfied with his revenge.<br> But when he strode triumphantly back into the bed- room, he froze.<br> A fly was walking over his pillow.<br> So there must have been two flies! But then, which one had he killed?<br> The innocent one or the guilty one? And if he&#x2019;d killed the innocent one by accident, would this mistake come back to haunt him one day?<br> <i>Would you please cut the shit? </i>he said to himself. And he started to get dressed.<br> Drinking down a hefty mug of espresso, he put on his last articles of clothing, looking sharp as a knife, opened the French door, and went out onto the veranda.<br> The day looked just like a picture postcard: a beach of golden sand, a turquoise sea, and a deep blue sky without so much as a hint of cloud. He could even see a sail far out on the water.<br> Taking a deep breath, Montalbano filled his lungs with the briny air and felt reborn.<br> To his right, at the water&#x2019;s edge, he noticed two men standing and quarreling. Although he was too far away to hear what they were saying, he could tell, from the agitated way they moved their hands and arms, that they were hav- ing a heated argument.<br> Then, all at once, one of the men made a move that Montalbano didn&#x2019;t get a good glimpse of at first. He seemed to bring his right hand suddenly forward, causing it to flash in the sun.<br> It was clearly a knife in the man&#x2019;s hand, but the other blocked it with both arms crossed and in the same motion kneed his adversary in the cojones. The two men then grabbed each other bodily, lost their balance, and fell, all the while struggling fiercely and rolling around in the sand in each other&#x2019;s clutches.<br> Without thinking twice, the inspector hopped down from the veranda and started running towards the men. As he drew near he began to hear their voices.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll kill you, you fucking bastard!&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ll cut your heart out and eat it!&#x201d;<br> The inspector was out of breath when he caught up to them.<br> By this point one man already had the upper hand and was straddling his opponent, pinning the other&#x2019;s open arms with his knees, practically sitting on his belly and battering his face with punches.<br> Just to stay on the safe side, Montalbano dealt the top man a powerful kick in the side, unsaddling him. Caught by surprise, the man fell sideways onto the sand, yelling:<br> &#x201c;Look out, he&#x2019;s got a knife!&#x201d;<br> The inspector turned around quickly.<br>The man who&#x2019;d been on the ground was now getting to his feet, and indeed he had a jackknife in his right hand.<br> Montalbano had made a big mistake. The more dangerous of the two men was the one who&#x2019;d been on the ground. But he didn&#x2019;t give him time even to open his mouth. With a kick to the face he sent him down to the ground again on his back, in the same position as before, as the knife flew a good distance away.<br> The other man, who had stood up again in the mean- time, immediately took advantage of the situation to jump back on top of his opponent and resume punching him.<br> Everything was back to square one.<br> So Montalbano bent down, seized the puncher by the shoulders, and tried to pull him off the other. But since the man put up no resistance, the inspector himself lost his bal- ance and fell back, belly up, as the puncher crashed down on top of him.<br> Then, fast as lightning, the man with the knife jumped on both of them at once. The puncher was kicking wildly, trying to hit the inspector in the balls, as Montalbano pum- meled him with his left fist while with his right he ham- mered the man on top of them both, who was trying in turn to blind the inspector with one hand and do the same to his adversary with the other.<br> They looked, in short, like a giant ball with six arms and six legs flying out as it rolled along the sand, a ball yelling curses, smacking punches, shouting threats, and dealing kicks. Until . . .<br> A voice, very close and imperious, commanded: <br>&#x201c;Stop or I&#x2019;ll shoot!&#x201d;<br>The three men froze and looked.<br> The person who&#x2019;d shouted was a lance corporal of the carabinieri, pointing a machine gun at them. Behind the cor- poral was another uniformed carabiniere, holding the jack- knife. Apparently they&#x2019;d been passing along the coastal road parallel to the beach, had seen three men brawling, and in- tervened.<br> &#x201c;Get on your feet!&#x201d;<br> The three men stood up.<br> &#x201c;Move!&#x201d; the corporal continued, gesturing with his head that they should walk towards a large paddy wagon parked along the road with a carabiniere at the wheel.<br> <i>To tell or not to tell? </i>Montalbano asked himself Hamletically as he walked along towards the van, wondering whether he should reveal the fact that he was a police inspector.<br> He came to the conclusion that it was best to tell the truth and clear up the mistake at once.<br> &#x201c;Just a minute. I am . . .&#x201d; he said, coming to a stop. <br>The whole group also halted and looked at him.<br> But the inspector was unable to continue, because at that very moment he remembered leaving his wallet with his police ID in the drawer of his nightstand.<br> &#x201c;So, you gonna tell us who you are?&#x201d; the corporal asked sarcastically.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll wait and tell your lieutenant,&#x201d; Montalbano replied, and he resumed walking.<br> Luckily the rear of the paddy wagon was covered by a tarp; otherwise, the whole town would have seen Inspector Montalbano ride past in the custody of the carabinieri, and the laughter would have been so loud they would have heard it all the way to the Italian mainland.<br> Once inside the carabinieri station, they were escorted in less than gentle fashion into a large room, where the corporal went and sat behind one of the two desks that were there.<br> He took his time, adjusted his jacket, stared long and hard at a ballpoint pen, opened a drawer, looked inside, closed it, cleared his throat, and finally began.<br> &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s start with you,&#x201d; he said, addressing Montalbano. &#x201c;Show me some kind of ID.&#x201d;<br> The inspector became anxious, realizing the situation was getting rather sticky. Better change the subject.<br> &#x201c;I had nothing to do with the dispute between these two men,&#x201d; he declared in a steady voice. &#x201c;I intervened to break it up. And these two, whom I don&#x2019;t even know, can confirm that.&#x201d;<br> He turned and looked at the others, who were standing three paces behind him, guarded by a carabiniere.<br> Then something strange happened.<br> &#x201c;All I know is that you kicked me in the side and it still hurts like hell,&#x201d; said the puncher.<br> &#x201c;And you kicked me in the face,&#x201d; said the man with the knife, pouring it on.<br> Suddenly Montalbano understood everything. Those two bastards knew perfectly well who he was and were now trying to make trouble for him.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll make you stop wanting to play the wise guy in a hurry,&#x201d; the corporal said menacingly. &#x201c;Give me that ID.&#x201d;<br>There were no two ways about it. Montalbano had to tell the truth.<br> &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t got it with me.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I forgot it at home.&#x201d;<br> The corporal rose to his feet.<br> &#x201c;You see, I live in a small house right . . .&#x201d;<br> The corporal came and stood directly in front of him. &#x201c;. . . right by the sea. And this morning <br>I . . .&#x201d;<br> The corporal grabbed him by the lapels of his jacket. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a police inspector!&#x201d; Montalbano shouted.<br> &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m a cardinal!&#x201d; the corporal retorted, as he started shaking the inspector back and forth, making his head bob like a ripe pear about to fall.<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on here?&#x201d; asked the carabinieri lieutenant and station commander upon entering the room.<br> Before answering, the lance corporal gave Montalbano one last violent shake.<br> &#x201c;I caught these three brawling on the beach. One of &#x2019;em had a jackknife. And this one here claims he&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Did he give you his name and address?&#x201d; &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Let go of him at once and show him into my office.&#x201d; The corporal looked at his superior in confusion. &#x201c;But . . .&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I gave you an order, Corporal!&#x201d; the lieutenant said sharply, cutting him off and leaving the room.<br> Montalbano congratulated the man in his mind. The lieutenant was saving them all from ridicule. He and the inspector knew each other from way back.<br>As they were walking down the corridor, the bewil- dered corporal turned to Montalbano and asked him in a soft voice:<br> &#x201c;Seriously, though, are you really a police inspector?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not on your life!&#x201d; Montalbano reassured him.<br> After everything had been cleared up and the lieutenant had given his apologies, which took about ten minutes, Montalbano left the carabinieri compound.<br> He had no choice but to go home and change clothes. In the scuffle he&#x2019;d not only gotten sand inside his private parts, but had also torn his shirt in the process and lost two buttons from his sports coat.<br> The best thing to do was to go to the station, which was barely a fifteen-minute walk away, and have somebody give him a ride home to Marinella.<br> He headed off.<br> But he felt pain in his left eye and right ear, and at some point he stopped in front of a shop window to look at himself. He&#x2019;d taken a hard punch square in the eye, and the skin around it was now starting to turn blue. On his ear he could<br> clearly see the imprints of two teeth.<br> As soon as Catarella saw him, he let out a yell that didn&#x2019;t seem human so much as the cry of an injured animal. Then he let loose with an avalanche of questions.<br> &#x201c;Wha&#x2019; happened, Chief ? Salt witta deathly weppin? Or a salt witta reggler weppin? Was ya hambushed? Eh? Wha&#x2019; happened? A car crash? A splosion? A fire wit&#x2019; crimminal intint?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Calm down, Cat,&#x201d; the inspector interrupted him. &#x201c;I just fell. Any news here?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nah, Chief. Oh, but a jinnelman come by &#x2019;iss mornin&#x2019; wantin&#x2019; a talk t&#x2019;yiz poissonally in poisson.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Did he tell you his name?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yessir, &#x2019;e did. Alfredo Pitruzzo.&#x201d;<br> He didn&#x2019;t know anyone by the name of Pitruzzo. <br>&#x201c;Is Gallo in?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yessir.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Tell him I want him to give me a ride home. I&#x2019;ll wait for him in the parking lot.&#x201d;<br> Pulling up to the house, he noticed another car parked alongside his own. He said good-bye to Gallo, opened the front door, and went inside. Hearing him come in, Adelina came out of the kitchen, looked at him, and started yelling, just like Catarella.<br> &#x201c;<i>Matre santa</i>, wha&#x2019; happen a you? Eh? Wha&#x2019; happen? My Gah, whatta mornin&#x2019;! Whatta terrible mornin&#x2019;!&#x201d;<br> What was Adelina talking about? Why was she saying these things? What was so terrible about the morning? What could have happened?<br> &#x201c;What do you mean, Adel�?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Isspector, when I come inna this a mornin&#x2019;, the whole a house a was empty, abannonned, you wasn&#x2019;t here anna French a door was open. A criminal coulda come in anna steal everytin&#x2019;. An&#x2019; when I was inna kitchen, I heard a some- one come in fro&#x2019; the veranda. I tought it was you an&#x2019; so I come out anna look. Bu&#x2019; it wasn&#x2019;t you, it was a man an&#x2019; &#x2019;e was a lookin&#x2019; aroun&#x2019;. I was sure &#x2019;e was a burglar an&#x2019; so I grabba fryin&#x2019; pan an&#x2019; I come a back out. Anna since &#x2019;e had&#x2019;is back a to me I whack &#x2019;im inna head witta big a fryin&#x2019; pan, an&#x2019; I knock &#x2019;im out! An&#x2019; so I tied &#x2019;is hands an&#x2019; feet witta rope, an&#x2019; I gag &#x2019;im an&#x2019; I put &#x2019;im inna broom a closet.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;But are you sure he was a burglar?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;&#x2019;Ow should I know? Bu&#x2019; sommabuddy &#x2019;oo comes inna sommabuddy ellis&#x2019;s &#x2019;ouse . . .&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;But why didn&#x2019;t you call me at the police station after you knocked him out?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;&#x2019;Cause first I &#x2019;adda take a care o&#x2019; the <i>pasta &#x2019;ncasciata</i>.&#x201d;<br> Montalbano appreciated her answer and went and opened the door to the broom closet. The man was crouching and looked at him with terrified eyes.<br> At first Montalbano was convinced the man couldn&#x2019;t be a burglar. He looked about sixty years old and was well- dressed and well-groomed. The inspector helped him to his feet, and after he removed the gag, the man immediately shouted:<br> &#x201c;Help!&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Inspector Montalbano, police!&#x201d; <br>The man seemed not to have heard.<br> &#x201c;Help!&#x201d; he shouted even louder than the first time. <br>And now he started shaking all over.<br> &#x201c;He . . . he . . . help! He . . . he . . . help!&#x201d;<br> The man no longer knew what he was saying, and there was no way to get him to pipe down. Montalbano made a snap decision and put the gag back on him.<br> Adelina, meanwhile, had come running from the kitchen and was standing beside the inspector.<br> The man&#x2019;s eyes were so bugged out with fear that they looked as if they might at any moment pop right out of their sockets. Since he was clearly too terrified to think straight, it would have been a mistake to untie him.<br> &#x201c;Give me a hand,&#x201d; the inspector said to Adelina. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll grab him by the shoulders, and you grab his feet.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Where are we taking him?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to put him in the armchair in front of the television.&#x201d;<br> As they were carrying him like a sack of potatoes, the inspector worked out a version of events in hopes of making the best of a bad situation.

Mann's handling of these concerns in this story of a middle-aged German writer, torn by his passion for a Polish youth met on holiday in Venice, resulted in a work of great psychological intensity and tragic power. It is presented here in an excellent new translation with extensive commentary on many facets of the story.</p></p><p>A tale of genius in which Thomas Mann explores the artist?s relation to life, <b>Death in Venice</b>, first published in 1912, is an acknowledged masterpiece of European short fiction.Thomas Mann was born in 1875 in Lubeck and studied art and literature at the University in Munich. He was only twenty-five when Buddenbrooks, his first major novel, was published. Before it was banned and burned by Hitler, it had sold over a million copies in Germany alone. In 1929 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature.

Today this book, cited by the United States Supreme Court and a host of other courts, remains the leading Health Law casebook in American law schools. The new 8th edition provides up-to-date coverage of the field in all of its complexity. The book offers new cases, statutory materials and classroom tested problems, along with succinct and sharpened notes, comments, charts and other teaching materials. It is fully up-to-date as of mid-2018, and it will be supplemented by a regularly updated website and, if appropriate, printed supplements. The book is more comprehensive but shorter than the last edition; you will find that it teaches extremely well.<br><br>The new edition has been carefully edited to sharpen its coverage while retaining all core materials. It thoroughly updates coverage of current issues in health insurance, accountable care organizations, the ACA, Medicare (including MACRA and &#x201c;provider compare&#x201d; websites), Medicaid (including the broader grounds for waivers under the Trump administration), and all the areas of conflict in today's health care political environment.<br><br>While the casebook retains the structure that has served teachers and students so well, the 8th edition reorganizes the health policy and reform materials and the section on state regulation of insurance and managed care to reflect changes in the law and the industry. The ERISA materials are separated into a distinct chapter, and there is a new chapter that provides an overview of the US healthcare system, along with a primer on health economics, insurance, managed care, and the tools available to policy makers. There is also a new chapter on discrimination and unequal treatment in health care. Issues raising the inequitable distribution of health resources can be found in almost every chapter.<br><br>The new edition also updates the bioethics materials so that they maintain a focus on the issues that are currently being litigated or legislated, like state conscience clauses, direct challenges to the principles of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, and medical aid in dying. The casebook is written to challenge teachers and students on all sides of the issues; the authors are a diverse group with no political or philosophical axe to grind.<br><br>In this edition the five original authors, Barry Furrow (Drexel), Thomas Greaney (Hastings), Sandra Johnson (SLU), Tim Jost (Washington and Lee), and Rob Schwartz (Hastings), are joined by five new authors who will be taking over future revisions of the casebook.

This was especially odd because I was raised in a Christian home, graduated from a Christian college, and then served as vice president of a prominent Christian organization. By all accounts, I should have been one of Christianity's biggest fans.<br><br>Unfortunately, I began to notice that the perceptions my friends and neighbors had about Christians were incredibly negative. In fact, their past experiences with anything labeled "Christian" had sent them running in the opposite direction. Ironically, I came to empathize with their views. Having grown up in a Christian bubble myself, I witnessed countless instances when the lives of Christ followers were incongruent with Jesus's call to be loving, engaged, sacrificial, unselfish, and compassionate contributors to culture. The angst these experiences created would scare anyone from taking a second look at Jesus.<br><br>I was deeply burdened by this trend and about the loss of Christian influence in our culture. So, with just a few months of savings in the bank and our second child on the way, my wife, Rebekah, and I decided I should quit my job and pursue a new vocation. We resolved to launch a nonprofit organization and make our first project the commissioning of research that would help us understand the perceptions that sixteen- to twenty-nine-year-olds have about Christians.<br><br>The study confirmed many of our fears about the negative perceptions I had experienced. An overwhelming percentage of non-Christians sampled said they perceived Christians as judgmental, hypocritical, too political, and antihomosexual, among other things.<br><br>In the truest sense, the research revealed what happens when Christians act unchristian. The study was released in a book by the same name. It soon became a bestseller, confirming that our findings resonated with the general public.<br><br>But it also exposed something bigger that has been going on. The Christian faith is quickly losing traction in Western culture, not only as a result of unchristian behavior, as significant as that is, but because we haven't recognized our new reality and adapted.<br><br>In years since, our nonprofit has convened rising Christian leaders at various locations across America to have conversations about what they see occurring in the Christian movement and how they are uniquely living out their faith. We began to ask important questions about the role Christians should play in society:<br><br>What does mission look like in America in the twenty-first century?<br><br>How should the message of the Gospel go forward?<br><br>What does it mean to be a Christian in a world that is disenchanted with our movement?<br><br>Every generation must ask these questions as they seek to confront the unique challenges of their own eras. In modern times, thinkers like Richard Niebuhr, C. S. Lewis, Francis Schaeffer, Os Guinness, and Lesslie Newbigin have reflected on the relationship between Christians and culture in the twentieth century. Even now, a diverse group of future-thinking leaders are offering insight into how the next generation might navigate our current cultural waters.<br><br>Research shows that over 76 percent of Americans self-identify as Christian.1 Yet I wonder how many of us are proud to carry that label. Are we hiding our faith in our back pockets? My guess is that many feel much like I did at twenty-seven when they encounter non-Christians at work, in coffee shops, on campus, in their neighborhoods, at weekend parties, or working out at the gym. You may be dumbfounded that there are 76 percent of "us" and yet little unity in what we collectively represent.<br><br>After observing cultural trends, collecting data, and having hundreds of conversations with Christian leaders, I see a new way forward. There is a whole movement of Christians-evangelicals, mainline Protestants, Orthodox, Pentecostals, and others-asking these same questions and offering meaningful answers. They want to be a force for restoration in a broken world even as we proclaim the Christian Gospel. They want the label Christian to mean something good, intelligent, authentic, true, and beautiful.<br><br>***<br><br>During a gathering convened by our nonprofit, I was offered a rare invitation to visit the home of Billy Graham in nearby Montreat, North Carolina. Typically, it's best to keep an experience like that to yourself, where its magnitude will never tarnish, but I feel compelled to share it with you here because of the significance of what took place.<br><br>The slow ascent up the winding mountain driveway in Montreat mirrored my rising anticipation. Going to meet with this great evangelist in his storied log cabin home nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains didn't feel real-I was rapt with expectation.<br><br>The leaves were changing color and produced a kaleidoscope of hues-from green to brown, yellow, orange, and red-on the surrounding mountain faces. After passing through the entry gate protecting his mountaintop home, we were greeted by an older woman, a caretaker of sorts. That day, she had taken it upon herself to care for us as well. Her kind but weathered hands served up one of my favorites-chocolate chip cookies and an old-fashioned bottle of Coke. It felt surprisingly warm and hospitable, like a weekend trip to Grandma's house.<br><br>While waiting to be led back to Mr. Graham's study on this crisp autumn day in September, we sat in old rocking chairs on the back porch. (I later learned these chairs had been gifts from President Lyndon Johnson from his ranch in Texas.)<br><br>Taking in the picturesque view, I could understand why Montreat had been the place this man chose to call home for more than fifty years. The quiet, pastoral scene was splendid. With no other man-made structure in sight, it was an ideal place of respite for the family of a world figure. The simplicity of his log cabin, meadowlike backyard, well-worn antique furniture, and pictures of family and friends playing together gave me a glimpse into this beloved saint's humanity.<br><br>I couldn't help considering the countless accolades assigned to his life. He had audience with the world's most powerful leaders, providing spiritual counsel to seven U.S. presidents. His generous tone and compelling life have marked everyone who's known him. He shaped our world very personally by leading tens of millions of everyday people to Christ. Having traveled the world many times over, the eighty-nine-year-old evangelist had witnessed what God was up to in the world. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity to converse with one of the most sought-after, respected, and revered leaders of the twentieth century. Our time together didn't disappoint.<br><br>As we walked back to his study, his companions-five dogs that kept him company day and night-greeted us. Though his body was undeniably old, his mind was sharp. Hearing had become a chore for him, so we raised our voices to introduce ourselves. I sat down in front of Mr. Graham in a chair whose previous occupants included world leaders, famous entertainers, and-just two weeks prior-a presidential candidate hoping to gain his support.<br><br>I came prepared to learn. I had no intention of saying much, planning instead to glean his wisdom. For what must have been thirty minutes or so, I quietly listened until I finally gained the courage to speak.<br><br>I carefully explained our work to educate and expose church and cultural leaders to the changes in our world, and more important, what opportunities lay ahead. Mr. Graham seemed genuinely curious to hear about what we do. I continued by telling him about some of the leaders our organization convened regularly, innovators within every sphere of society. From the arts to medicine and education, I explained that they were young and the best at what they did. I described how these leaders were leveraging their talent for the benefit of others-creating microfinance banks that were lending hundreds of millions of dollars to the poor, building wells throughout the third world, developing media campaigns to increase awareness about adoption, and so forth-and were serious about restoring culture. I had a hunch that these remarkably likeminded individuals were the next wave of Christians in the world, but I wanted to know if he agreed.<br><br>He reflected on everything I had been sharing with him before a smile walked the sides of his face. "Back when we did these big, large crusades in football stadiums and arenas, the Holy Spirit was really moving-and people were coming to Christ by hearing the Word of God preached," the evangelist said. "But today, I sense something different is happening. I see evidence that the Holy Spirit is working in a new way. He's moving through people where they work and through one-on-one relationships to accomplish great things. They are demonstrating God's love to those around them, not just with words, but in deed."<br><br>As he spoke, something began to crystallize inside me. It was as if all the observations I'd collected over a decade were being summed up in the sage words of this iconic figure. He had seen the best of what twentieth-century Christianity had to offer, yet was in tune with something new.<br><br>I left Montreat with a quiet confidence that day-not only because I had been in the presence of a great and godly man, but also because he had confirmed in succinct terms the things I'd been observing. Reflecting on his words challenged me to continue cultivating this mind-set throughout the body of believers across our developing landscape.<br><br>***<br><br>Not long after my conversation with Graham, Rebekah and I celebrated our tenth wedding anniversary with a trip to Europe. Since it was the off season, we were braced for the wet, dreary weather typical of London and Paris at that time of year. However, to our amazement, the region experienced a run of the warmest days on their calendar in a century. Instead of being wet, bundled up, and longing for the warmth of the cozy H�tel du Louvre, we enjoyed long walks in the cool breeze-wearing sweaters and scarves, leaving the coats behind. It was enchanting. The architecture, museums, and caf�s were brimming with energy. Experiencing millennium-old culture that was still full of life refreshed my soul.<br><br>One portion of our travels that I was particularly excited about was our rail trip from London to Paris on the famed EuroStar. I had read about its top speeds of 190 miles per hour as it glides under the English Channel and through the French countryside en route to Paris's Gare du Nord. When we boarded the train, I knew we were in for a great experience.<br><br>As I leaned back in my seat, the headrest curved perfectly around my neck-like an apparatus designed for intense flight, somehow befitting such a modernized tour of these storied countries. The ride across Britain was routine and somewhat metropolitan. Then as the train entered the Channel Tunnel, it picked up speed. The blur of lights gave the impression of flying through space. By the time we emerged in France, I felt transported. Leaning back in my seat, I stared out at the countryside as it sped past me like an abbreviated survey of French history. I'd flown over this landscape at high speed before, but never through it.<br><br>The foreground was an imperceptible blur of vegetation broken only by the occasional buildings and bridges. My eyes were drawn to the horizon as a steady succession of towns and villages rose into view along the way. We passed through Calais, then Lille, as we made our way toward Paris.<br><br>A pattern seemed to be emerging. In each community I saw a town center surrounded by trees and an occasional cottage. And at the heart of every town I could see a church steeple appear among the treetops and above the storefronts. It was consistent with what I knew of ancient urban architecture, that the steeple was designed to be the tallest structure in a city, representing the sacred belief that the church should be the closest point between heaven and earth, God and humanity.<br><br>Miles apart, those communities now seemed lined up almost side by side, as if to make a collective statement for my observation: The church used to occupy the center of culture in the West. For a brief moment, I reminisced about what once was. Not too long ago, children would frequent their church for much-needed education and moral training. In this prime location, new families were welcomed to town and volunteer needs were addressed before singing and prayer meetings would resume. Houses of worship were also places of great artistic and musical innovation. Many of history's greatest creative minds birthed their monolithic works within these hallowed confines.<br><br>Indeed, where the church in Europe once held a place of significant influence, by the end of the twentieth century it was almost completely irrelevant.2 Even the design of their communities bore evidence to it. The steeples that once stood for spiritual enlightenment have been reduced to minor tourist attractions. They better serve the needs of visiting amateur photographers than the lost souls of the people in their own communities.<br><br>Some culture watchers say that when we survey the contours of Europe's religious landscape, we are staring America's future in the face. While there is no way to verify these predictions, from my experience and all the evidence I've collected surrounding the church and citizens of our country, America isn't far behind.<br><br>What began as a creeping intuition that led me to launch a new organization had become a nagging reality that significant changes were under way. My trip to Europe and Montreat seemed to represent the two ends of our current situation. In Montreat, I met with a vanguard from Christianity's past who recognizes how the faith is presently shifting. In Europe, I seemingly caught a glimpse of America's more secular future. Positioned between these poles was the empirical research we had commissioned and the hundreds of conversations with a new generation of Christian leaders. Each situation echoed the sentiment that many Christians have lost confidence in their faith. Our movement, as a whole, was quickly declining in the West.<br><br>I believe this moment is unlike any other time in history. Its uniqueness demands an original response. If we fail to offer a different way forward, we risk losing entire generations to apathy and cynicism. Our friends will continue to drift away, meeting their need for spiritual transcendence through other forms of worship and communities of faith that may be less true but more authentic and appealing.<br><br>Maybe you know someone like my friend Dan. He grew up around the church and considers himself a Christian. At the age of thirty-four, he finds himself at the center of huge international business deals. Dan's a rainmaker type, and when his complex transactions are successful, they can raise the GDP of entire nations! But as we were catching up on our lives that day, he dropped a bomb on me. He said, "I hope this won't shock you, but I don't call myself a Christian anymore. I follow Christ as faithfully as I can, but I don't ever want to be associated with what that word, or that 'brand,' has come to represent in the world."<br><br> <br><br></p><h2>White Fragility: Why It&#39;s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism</h2><p><p><b>The International Bestseller</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>Anger. Fear. Guilt. Denial. Silence. These are the ways in which ordinary white people react when it is pointed out to them that they have done or said something that has - unintentionally - caused racial offence or hurt.

Using knowledge and insight gained over decades of running racial awareness workshops and working on this idea as a Professor of Whiteness Studies, she shows us how we can start having more honest conversations, listen to each other better and react to feedback with grace and humility. It is not enough to simply hold abstract progressive views and condemn the obvious racists on social media - change starts with us all at a practical, granular level, and it is time for all white people to take responsibility for relinquishing their own racial supremacy. </p><p>'With clarity and compassion, DiAngelo allows us to understand racism as a practice not restricted to "bad people."

Wait. Who are we kidding? Hikaru: sure and steady...? Yeah, right! In between all the shenanigans Hikaru gets himself into during school and after, and dealing with Sai&#39;s unhappy sobs when Hikaru tries to run away from playing Go, his fame is growing. Principals, teachers and Go tournament kids alike are all wondering who this unruly bronco of a Go player is. Tetsuo, a Shogi punk who has a beef of his own with Akira, harasses poor Hikaru at first--then later puts him on his own Go team! Meanwhile, Akira, looking for a rematch with Hikaru, is surprised to find Hikaru playing with a third-rate Go club.

In Edo period Japan, a strange new disease called the Red Pox has begun to prey on the country&#39;s men. Within eighty years of the first outbreak, the male population has fallen by seventy-five percent. Women have taken on all the roles traditionally granted to men, even that of the Shogun. The men, precious providers of life, are carefully protected. And the most beautiful of the men are sent to serve in the Shogun&#39;s Inner Chamber...</p><p>Fumi Yoshinaga is a Tokyo-born manga creator who debuted in 1994 with Tsuki to Sandaru (The Moon and the Sandals). In 2006, she was named one of the top twenty creators who have contributed to the world of shojo manga by Professor Masami Toku in her touring exhibit Shojo Manga: Girl Power! Yoshinaga has won numerous awards, including the 2002 Kodansha Manga Award for her series Antique Bakery and the 2006 Japan Media Arts Festival Excellence Award for �oku.Starred Review. The Edo period of an alternate Japan is ruled entirely by women in this manga. A mysterious plague has killed three out of four boys for generations, so men are carefully guarded and sheltered, while women go about the business of daily life. The Ooku was an area of Edo Castle reserved for the shogun's concubines and female relatives; here the shogun is a woman and the Ooku is entirely male. One of the few serious works of alternate history in contemporary manga, <i>Ooku</i> explores the relationship between gender and culture in subtle and unexpected ways. It begins tightly focused on a single heroic character and slowly pans out from there, embracing first the court intrigue of the Ooku, then the new Shogun and Japan as a whole and finally the outside world, unaware and free of the plague. Yoshinaga is the acclaimed creator of <i>Antique Bakery</i>, which has been made into both a Japanese television series and a smash hit Korean movie. Not as visually busy as many historical works, <i>Ooku</i>'s art has a spare, elegant aesthetic that shines with carefully chosen detail. Yoshinaga's work is wry and stately by turns, doing full justice to the book's rich tapestry of stories. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

We assumed we could control the biological productivity of salmon and 'improve' upon natural processes that we didn't even try to understand. We assumed we could have salmon without rivers." --from the introduction From a mountain top where an eagle carries a salmon carcass to feed its young to the distant oceanic waters of the California current and the Alaskan Gyre, salmon have penetrated the Northwest to an extent unmatched by any other animal. Since the turn of the twentieth century, the natural productivity of salmon in Oregon, Washington, California, and Idaho has declined by eighty percent. The decline of Pacific salmon to the brink of extinction is a clear sign of serious problems in the region.In <i>Salmon Without Rivers</i>, fisheries biologist Jim Lichatowich offers an eye-opening look at the roots and evolution of the salmon crisis in the Pacific Northwest. He describes the multitude of factors over the past century and a half that have led to the salmon's decline, and examines in depth the abject failure of restoration efforts that have focused almost exclusively on hatcheries to return salmon stocks to healthy levels without addressing the underlying causes of the decline. The book: describes the evolutionary history of the salmon along with the geologic history of the Pacific Northwest over the past 40 million years considers the indigenous cultures of the region, and the emergence of salmon-based economies that survived for thousands of years examines the rapid transformation of the region following the arrival of Europeans presents the history of efforts to protect and restore the salmon offers a critical assessment of why restoration efforts have failed Throughout, Lichatowich argues that the dominant worldview of our society -- a worldview that denies connections between humans and the natural world -- has created the conflict and controversy that characterize the recent history of salmon; unless that worldview is challenged and changed, there is little hope for recovery. <i>Salmon Without Rivers<i> exposes the myths that have guided recent human-salmon interactions. It clearly explains the difficult choices facing the citizens of the region, and provides unique insight into one of the most tragic chapters in our nation's environmental history.</i></i></p><p>The image of salmon battling upstream through whitewater cataracts to spawn in their birthplace is integral to any happy vision of the Pacific Northwest. Sadly, because they face more insidious obstacles than swift currents, few people today actually witness this remarkable spectacle. Armed with exhaustive research and an ability to synthesize his findings into a concise, readable indictment of the status quo, Jim Lichatowich, a fisheries scientist for 30 years, traces the sudden decline of Northwest salmon populations following the onset of Euro-American settlement. He points a finger at the usual suspects: logging, mining, damming, grazing, irrigation, commercial fishing, and development. Moreover, he cites the political establishment for a failure of nerve. Since the shift from a Native American "gift" economy based on sustainability to a profit economy based on self-interest and short-term financial gain, the historically resilient salmon have met one adversary after another, with little or no help from the legal apparatus charged with their protection. In fact, federal and state governments have responded to the deepening crisis mainly by building fish hatcheries up and down the West Coast. Contrary to the beliefs of entrenched bureaucrats and sport fishermen, says Lichatowich, hatcheries have merely diluted the gene pools of wild stocks while allowing resource extractors to continue their multifarious operations and politicians to shirk their responsibilities. In 1960, for instance, after decades of declining runs, the Washington Department of Fisheries reported, incredibly (and characteristically), that new advanced management techniques would soon result in "salmon without a river"--more welcome news to those who would continue to exploit these iconic fish and their habitat. At the dawn of the 21st century hundreds of hatcheries still operate, yet Northwest salmon populations have decreased 95 percent. <p> Lichatowich is a learned and persuasive advocate for wild salmon. He's also eloquent, as in this description of his first visit to the Columbia River's Grand Coulee dam: </p><blockquote>As I sat there wondering and swatting mosquitoes, the face of the dam lit up. It was the start of the nightly laser show.... Appropriately, the lasers sent a series of large green dollar signs floating through the darkness. Then a series of laser salmon swam across the face of the dam. Here were the ideal salmon, I thought, the fish that fit perfectly into our worldview. We have complete control over them--press a button and they appear; press another and they change from green to red; press another and they swim over the dam. Salmon and dams are compatible--as long as you are not particular about the kind of salmon.</blockquote> So what to do? Lichatowich opines that we need a new "worldview," one that places natural resources within a context of respect and sustainability. He looks to state and federal governments to enforce the protections already granted by laws like the Endangered Species Act. And he sees evidence that public perceptions may be changing on such issues as habitat conservation and biodiversity; breaching four dams on the lower Snake River to aid fish passage would have been unthinkable even in the early 1990s. Whether this new worldview can save salmon in time is another question. <i>--Langdon Cook</i>Jim Lichatowich has been a fisheries scientist for twenty-nine years, working for most of that time in salmon management and research in Oregon and Washington. He is a member of three independent teams of scientists investigating the salmon crisis, and has written numerous scientific and technical papers on the history, current status, and future prospects of salmon. His essays have appeared in a variety of publications including <i>Trout</i> magazine, <i>Peninsula</i> magazine, <i>Riverkeeper</i>, and <i>Shirkin Comment</i>.<br></p><h2>A Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans: with A Theory of Meaning (Volume 12) (Posthumanities)</h2><p>Is the tick a machine or a machine operator? Is it a mere object or a subject? With these questions, the pioneering biophilosopher Jakob von Uexk�ll embarks on a remarkable exploration of the unique social and physical environments that individual animal species, as well as individuals within species, build and inhabit. This concept of the umwelt has become enormously important within posthumanist philosophy, influencing such figures as Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Deleuze and Guattari, and, most recently, Giorgio Agamben, who has called Uexk�ll "a high point of modern antihumanism."<br>A key document in the genealogy of posthumanist thought, <i>A Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans</i> advances Uexk�ll's revolutionary belief that nonhuman perceptions must be accounted for in any biology worth its name; it also contains his arguments against natural selection as an adequate explanation for the present orientation of a species' morphology and behavior. <i>A Theory of Meaning</i> extends his thinking on the <i>umwelt</i>, while also identifying an overarching and perceptible unity in nature. Those coming to Uexk�ll's work for the first time will find that his concept of the <i>umwelt</i> holds out new possibilities for the terms of animality, life, and the whole framework of biopolitics itself.</p><p>Jakob von Uexk�ll (1864-1944) was born in Estonia and educated at the University of Heidelberg and the Zoological Center in Naples.

With an emphasis on both �practice� and �presence,� the book reclaims the tradition of �soul care� for the pastoral ministry, thereby complementing the medical, or crisis intervention, model of pastoral care with a wellness/growth model of pastoral care. <p>Listening for the Soul: �Challenges clergy to take seriously the relationship between pastoral care and spiritual direction. �Integrates theological and psychological insights with issues of spiritual life and formation. �Includes a chapter on the spiritual formation of children. �Provides practical guidance for integrating spiritual direction with pastoral care. �Tends to the pastoral caregivers own needs for spiritual deepening. �Includes reflection questions and case studies to enable the text to function on both the individual reader and classroom levels.</p></p><p>From the Introduction (pre-publication version): <p>Listening for the Soul Again </p><p>Look on my right hand and see&#x2014; there is no one who takes notice of me; no refuge remains to me; no one cares for me. </p><p>I cry to you, O Lord; I say, &#x201c;You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.&#x201d; </p><p>I stretch out my hands to you; my soul thirsts for you like a parched land. </p><p>Psalms 142:4-5; 143:6 </p><p>Those of us who are privileged to carry out the ministry of pastoral care are becoming increasingly aware that we have neglected to listen for the soul. What North American mainline Protestant churches once understood to be central in pastoral care is now marginal in pastoral practice. Because we have neglected to foster soulfulness (soul fullness),1 the church and the world alike cry out like the psalmist of old: &#x201c;No one cares for me. . . . My soul thirsts for you like a parched land.&#x201d; A jarring dichotomy exists between society&#x2019;s pervasive longing for meaningful spirituality and the faltering pastoral responses of Protestant churches. </p><p>The Public Quest for Soulfulness The world is crying out for the church to be more like the church, to represent the space and place where holiness, meaning, and God can be found, experienced, understood, and reimagined. Yet even at the beginning of a new century, for many, the traditional patterns of religious life remain too patriarchal, inadequate, and even obsolete. For others, the church seems too much in appearance like the world&#x2014;too busy, too tired, too involved, too demanding, too unstable, too spiritually impoverished, too leadership deprived. </p><p>At the same time that such strong and ambivalent feelings are being expressed about the church, people remain interested in spiritual matters. Spirituality is newsworthy and remains marketable. Pollsters report on religious trends and affiliations. Popular television programs from Touched by an Angel to NYPD Blue regularly address spiritual matters. Also, the increased plurality of North American society and the visible presence of Eastern religions have heightened our consciousness of spiritual traditions and the spiritual life. People are consistently providing evidence that there is a deep-seated craving for religious sensibilities and rituals. Even taking into account the sentimentality triggered by the Christmas holiday season, the notable increase in attendance at Christmas Eve services can be partly attributed to the fact that people want to connect in some way with the holy mystery of the Christmas event. Some men and women openly confess the need to feel more spiritually connected and alive. These needs are frequently demonstrated through pursuits that seek to merge the psychological, medical, and spiritual paradigms. Zealous interest in Yoga, Tai Chi, massage, meditation, and relaxation therapies, and chiropractic, homeopathic, and naturopathic care indicates that ours is a time of intense personal and social yearning for spiritual wholeness. </p><p>In such a climate, it is not surprising that enrollment levels for university and college religious studies courses have soared. People are devising personal spiritual belief systems and seeking with renewed vigor places and practices that put them in touch with spiritual values. Most bookstores contain entire sections on New Age spirituality, women&#x2019;s and men&#x2019;s spiritualities, and alternative health. The number of books (including this one!) published in the last few years with the word soul in their titles is staggering. We gorge on books, hoping to digest clues for fixing our bodies, our businesses, our relationships, our addictions, and now even our souls. No longer are retreat centers the sole/soul enterprise of the church. All sorts of healing, inner renewal, and spirituality centers are springing up in a secular context, advertised as getaway places from the stresses of work and our technological addictions. Alternative and holistic approaches to caring for body, mind, and soul are rapidly finding their way into an eager consumer-driven market. Attending to the soul, in all its emptiness and fullness, has now become a trendy and profitable enterprise. When our hunger is so intense, it seems that we will eat anything put before us that promises nourishment. </p><p>Many pastoral caregivers are acutely aware that people are desperately seeking to make connections with holiness, the mystery of life, and the divine force of creation. The reordering of priorities brought about by a decrease in financial resources, changes in employment and work patterns, and external stresses placed upon personal time commitments has led to a lack of balance in life. Many people simply are overextended and unable to discern what leads to a balanced life and what leads to burnout and long-term disability, the new dis-eases of our time. The fact of change has produced increased anxiety and turned up the volume of noise in our souls. So, too, the ever-widening gap between the haves and the have-nots and a growing discomfort with the idolatrous nature of consumerism have evoked in many a quest for simplicity and a renewed spiritual life. </p><p>Protestant churches are now scrambling to respond to this renewed interest in matters of the soul, but it is clear that they are ill equipped to do so. Indeed, they are almost frantic in their quest to catch up with the public&#x2019;s emphasis upon matters of the soul, and they fear that inaction may indeed hasten the demise of the church&#x2019;s capacity to address spiritual matters and care for the soul. The church fears that its failure to attend to the soul has contributed to destructive patterns of disconnection with God, others, ourselves, and the earth. </p><p>While the public&#x2019;s interest in soul matters is surging, Protestant churches continue to flounder in their response to this phenomenon.

It may not have been the result of deliberate government policy, yet British &#x2018;obtuseness, short-sightedness and ignorance&#x2019; &#x2013; and stubborn commitment to laissez-faire &#x2018;solutions&#x2019; &#x2013; largely caused the disaster and prevented any serious efforts to relieve suffering. The continuing impact on Anglo-Irish relations was incalculable, the immediate human cost almost inconceivable. In this vivid and disturbing book Cecil Woodham-Smith provides the definitive account. &#x2018;A moving and terrible book. It combines great literary power with great learning. It explains much in modern Ireland &#x2013; and in modern America&#x2019; D.W. Brogan.</p><p><b>Cecil Blanche Woodman-Smith</b> was a British historian and author of popular history books on the Victorian era, including <i>The Great Hunger, Queen Victoria, The Reason Why, </i>and <i>Thin Men of Hadda</i>. She was appointed CBE in 1960, and received honorary doctorates from the National University of Ireland and the University of St. Andrews. She died in 1977.Frederick Davidson reads this immensely detailed audiobook with a rich English accent. It's as if a robed Oxford don is giving a series of lectures on the Irish potato famine and its consequences. Davidson reads the myriad English and Irish names of people and places, as well as the many complicated sentences, without a stumble. The problem with this audiobook is that its very "Englishness" would likely be difficult for many American ears to listen to for 25 hours.

He read deeply in the French revolutionary philosophers. From Rousseau he evolved the idea that imagination divorced from reason produces monsters, but that coupled with reason "it is the mother of the arts and the source of&nbsp;their wonders." In Spain he saw a country that had abandoned reason, and he peopled <i>Los Caprichos </i>with the grotesque monsters that result from such an action. Plate after plate shows witches, asses, devils, and&nbsp;other strange creatures, many of which are caricatures of members of the society against which Goya was fighting. <br>The plates were first published in 1799. There are still in existence, however, six extremely rare sets of artist's proofs, considered&nbsp;by most who have managed to see them as infinitely superior to the work actually published. Now, for the first time, this edition reproduces one of these sets of 80 prints, together with the "Prado" manuscript, a commentary on the plates. In addition, this collection contains supplementary material to the <i>Los Caprichos</i> series, inlcuding a never-before-published study for Caprichos 10; three unique proofs of plates probably intended for publication with the others; a preliminary drawing for plate I, a self-portrait of Goya (which appears as the frontispiece to this volume); and a unique proof of "Woman in Prison" which may represent an earlier version of Caprichos 32.</p><p>The last of the Old Masters and the first of the Moderns, Francisco Goya (1746-1828) was a court painter whose portraits of the Spanish royal family exhibit a remarkable frankness and lack of flattery. Goya&#x2019;s later works took on a darker cast and are considered the precursors to the Expressionist movement.Text: English, Spanish (translation)</p><h2>The Catechism of the Catholic Church and the Craft of Catechesis</h2><p><p>The theme of this book is that the <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i>, perhaps the most important work on catechesis since the Apostolic Age, offers not only a new, definitive account for our times of the full teaching of the Catholic faith, but also that it is a superbly crafted work from which to learn and to teach the faith. This book reveals the pedagogy embedded in the <i>Catechism</i>, showing every teacher, parent, catechist or student how to discover the key principles that enable one to learn from, and teach from, the <i>Catechism</i>.</p><p><i>The Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church</i> speaks of the "wisdom of the presentation" of the <i>Catechism</i> and of "the depth of its spirituality". These points have rarely been explained in any sustained way and have never before been systematically treated. The unique point about this book is that it focuses on these points, rather than a simple explanation of the content of the Catechism. This book offers a pedagogical approach to the <i>Catechism</i> for handing on the faith of the Catholic Church in any setting, whether home, school and parish. It offers perennially valid teaching points drawn from a perennial text, and an explanation of the 'pedagogy of God' which underpins all authentic teaching methods in the Church. In this way, the book offers a twelve step 'path to recovery' out of unhealthy catechetical addictions and obsessions which have bedeviled the catechetical world.</p><p>It is unique in its origin, emerging from a 'catechetical friendship', encouraged by Cardinal Sch�nborn, between three institutions working in an authentic Catholic catechetical tradition. The three authors display a deep trust and love for the words of the <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i> &#x2013; words that hold a rich heritage and can be pondered lovingly and searchingly, since they are for our good, for everyone's good.</p></p><p>Barbara Morgan cofounded Austin Film Festival in 1993 and has served as Executive Director since its inception.

The Adeona, one of the ships belonging to the North West Company of Canada, was bringing furs to the auction markets of London.<br><br>The cliffs of England. Of home.<br><br>A clerk of the company, one of those whose task it was to accompany the furs across the Atlantic and to transact the company's business in London, stood at the rail of the ship, one arm propping him against it, the other hand clinging to a taut rope attached to the rigging, his feet planted firmly apart for better balance, and tested the thought in his mind.<br><br>Home.<br><br>Soon he would set his feet again on his native soil, the very soil he had shaken from them four years before without a moment's hesitation. As he had once said to someone in England, though he did not care to remember whom, he had liked the sight of the sea because it represented his escape from England. And he had escaped.<br><br>But she had said that perhaps it was from himself he wished to escape and that it could not be done. For wherever he went, however far he ran, he must inevitably take himself along too.<br><br>She had been right. He had taken himself to Canada-to Lower Canada to be precise, to Montreal. And since that had not by any means been far enough, then he had become a clerk with the North West Company, a group of merchants and traders in furs, and had taken himself off with a canoe brigade beyond Lower Canada, even beyond the limits of Upper Canada, beyond the limits of civilization.<br><br>Three thousand miles beyond Montreal he had journeyed. He had spent three years there, in the Athabasca country, with only a handful of other fur-trading men and the native inhabitants of the country for company.<br><br>He could have gone no farther without falling entirely off the end of the world, it had seemed, though some men had crossed the barrier of the mountains and reached the Pacific Ocean. And of course, it was true that he had taken himself every inch of the way. The only difference was that he had come to like himself a little better while that far away from home. While that far away from his memories.<br><br>But of course he could not escape memories as effectively as he had escaped from an island. They kept intruding. They were only as far away as his mind. And so he was coming back home for a few months. He might have stayed in the interior for years-most clerks of the company did, earning partnership by slow degrees and hard work. But he had requested, and been granted, a position in Montreal for a year. And because even there he could not be free of his past, he had requested, and been granted, the task of bringing the furs to auction.<br><br>And now he was almost back where he had started. Sometimes the mist and the water met so that he could no longer see the cliffs of southern England, but he knew they were there. And the Adeona was taking him very surely to London.<br><br>He did not want to be there. Or in any other part of England. Least of all in Yorkshire, where he had lived most of his life. But he would not go there. He would be working in London. There would be no time to make the ultimate journey home. And there was no point. There was nothing to be gained by going back there.<br><br>That particular episode in his life was long in the past. Long ago in his youth, when one could be expected to make mistakes. He had made one-more than one, perhaps-and he had tried to put it right. Tried until he had thought he was going mad. And failed. There was nothing he could do about it now.<br><br>It would be better to stay away from there. He was coming back to England. Surely that was enough. There was no need to worry the wound until it was quite raw again.<br><br>And yet it was that very episode from his youth that he sometimes thought would always prevent him from being entirely free.<br><br>He would not think of it. The sea was choppy. He looked down into its gray depths as the ship beneath his feet dipped and heaved. And he took off his beaver hat, which had been pulled low over his brow, in order to let the damp wind blow through his dark, overlong hair.<br><br>He probably would not have to go home to Yorkshire in order to see his parents. They would doubtless be in London to see him, and probably staying with Alex. Alex! Yes, for years before he left for Canada his sister had been the most important person in his world. She had married the Earl of Amberley after his departure and now had a son and a daughter. He longed to see them-and her, of course. It was surely worth coming home just to see Alex and discover if she had found the happiness she had never known as a girl.<br><br>She had never been allowed to be happy then. Neither had he. They had had the misfortune to have a father whose firmly held religious beliefs led him to eliminate all enjoyment from life, both for himself and for his family. And of course, there had been the dreadful quarrel between himself and his father, unresolved before he left and surely unresolvable now.<br><br>James Purnell sighed and looked up to the dimly visible cliffs of England again. Why was it that it was possible to hate and to love both at the same time? How was it that he could hate his father and reject all that he stood for and resent what his father had done to his life and to Alex's and yet at the same time love him and crave his understanding and his approval? He was a man of thirty years, and yet he seemed to have a child's need for a parent's affection.<br><br>"James?"<br><br>A light and welcome voice broke in on his thoughts, and he turned to watch the careful and somewhat unsteady approach of a small, slim girl whose brown hair was neatly confined beneath her bonnet and whose shapely form was concealed behind the folds of a heavy cloak. Her lips smiled, and her cheeks were already rosy from the freshness of the wind. Her eyes were sparkling.<br><br>"Duncan knocked on my door to tell Miss Hendricks and me that the coast of England was visible," she said, as he took her elbow in a firm clasp and guided her to the rail, where she would have something firm and safe to cling to. "And I saw immediately through the porthole that it was true. I simply had to come up on deck for a better look. England, James! I can scarce believe it."<br><br>"Your first sight of it, Jean," he said, smiling indulgently. "I can remember my first sight of Canada four years ago. I know just the excitement you are feeling."<br><br>She smiled up at him before returning her wide-eyed gaze to the distant cliffs. "It has been worth it after all," she said. "The dreadful food and the incessant motion and Miss Hendricks sick almost from the moment of our embarking." She giggled. "She has not been much of a chaperone after all, has she, the poor dear?"<br><br>"But you have had your brother to watch after you," he said.<br><br>She breathed in a deep lungful of salty air and closed her eyes. "I am so happy that Father said I could come with Duncan to join him in London," she said. "I have always wanted to see London. Is it really the most exciting city in the world?"<br><br>James Purnell smiled again. "I have not seen many of the rest of them to make comparisons," he said. "But I suppose it is exciting, if you like that type of excitement."<br><br>"You have a sister here, don't you?" she said. "And parents. You must be very happy about seeing them again."<br><br>"Yes." He gazed at the cliffs with dark, inscrutable eyes. "I was always extremely fond of Alex. She is five years younger than I. And my mother will be pleased to see me, I think."<br><br>The girl wrinkled her nose. "Well, of course she will," she said. "Will they be in London? I would dearly like to meet your family."<br><br>He looked down at her. "I have no idea," he said. "I may have to travel down into Hampshire to see my sister. She is married to the Earl of Amberley. He has a large estate close to the sea. We will doubtless sail almost within sight of their home."<br><br>"She is a countess?" she asked, her eyes widening. "You did not mention that before. And your father is a baron, is he not?"<br><br>"Lord Beckworth," he said.<br><br>"It must be wonderful to be someone of some importance in London," she said. "To have entry to all the most fashionable gatherings. And this is the time of the Season, is it not?"<br><br>"June?" he said. "So it is. But your father is not precisely a nobody, Jean. Douglas Cameron, partner in the company, respected merchant. You will have an opportunity to enjoy yourself, never fear."<br><br>"Perhaps," she said with a sigh. "But he is not exactly high ton, is he? Far from it. I suppose you are. Or were. And will be again as soon as you set foot on English ground. You are very fortunate."<br><br>"Yes," he said.<br><br>He had spent his first year in the Athabasca country with Duncan Cameron, the girl's brother. Naturally enough, when he had discovered his old friend in Montreal two years later, they had renewed their friendship. And he had become acquainted with Jean Cameron. He had not seen a great deal of her, as she had only recently finished her schooling at a convent, though her family was not Catholic.<br><br>Her presence on board ship had been like a breath of fresh air. Her spirits had not been dampened either by the tedium of the long days or by the indisposition of her chaperone, Miss Hendricks, a schoolmistress who was returning to England to keep house for a recently widowed brother. Jean Cameron had spent a great deal of her time with her brother and with him. She treated him almost as if he were another brother, but he was not sure he could see her as a sister. On several occasions he had resisted with some effort the urge to kiss her.<br><br>He must resist. A kiss to so young and strictly brought up a young lady would seem very little different from a proposal of marriage. And he was not in the marriage market. Not for her or anyone else.<br><br>They lapsed into silence. Jean seemed content to gaze her fill at the coast of England and to dream of the enjoyment the summer in London would bring. And James Purnell appeared to forget her presence beside him. His lean, weather-bronzed face grew hard and he gazed sightlessly at the cliffs that were so enthralling his companion.<br><br>He was thinking of another woman, yet another burden he had carried around with him for four long years. Madeline. Lady Madeline Raine. She had told him that he would take himself wherever he went. She had not also said that he would carry her around inside his head just as surely. Madeline with her bright, fair curls and eager, vital face. Madeline with her tall, slender, lithe form. Madeline, talkative and frivolous and empty-headed.<br><br>Or so he had always told himself, as if he needed somehow to convince himself that what he had felt for her had been nothing but a physical passion. Nothing serious. Nothing lasting. Only enough to haunt his every waking moment and his every dream for four years.<br><br>Though that must, of course, be an exaggeration. Pure sentimentality.<br><br>He needed to see her again. Perhaps it was to see her more than for any other reason that he was making this unnecessary journey. He must convince himself that there really was no substance to his dreams. He must rid himself of the obsession.<br><br>For he was no more free to love than he had been four years before. Free to marry, perhaps, if he so wished. But not free to love.<br><br>He would free himself of her, at least. It was necessary to see her. To see that she was six and twenty years old now, past her prime, her beauty and vitality doubtless faded.<br><br>And he doubtless would see her. She was Alex's sister-in-law, Amberley's sister. And still unmarried, according to Alex's last letter, though she had been betrothed the summer before to an officer of the Guards, wounded at the Battle of Waterloo. The engagement had been broken, however-typical of Madeline and her shallow nature. Except that perhaps she was not really shallow. Perhaps he had just made her so in his mind so that he would not love her.<br><br>Her twin brother, Dominic, Lord Eden, had married, Alex had announced in that last letter. But not Madeline. He wished she had married her officer. He could have forgotten about her then.<br><br>Perhaps.<br><br>"Will you be going to any balls, do you suppose?" Jean Cameron asked.<br><br>He looked down at her wistful face and smiled. "Not if I can avoid them," he said. But he felt again the tenderness for her youth and eagerness that he was finding hard to resist. "But if I do have an invitation that cannot be refused, I shall take you along with me-if you wish it and your father permits it, of course."<br><br>Her face lit up so that once more he had to hold himself aloof, prevent himself from bending forward and brushing her lips affectionately with his own. "Oh, would you?" she said. "Would you really, James?" Her eyes focused on a point over his shoulder. "Duncan," she called. "Come and hear what James has just promised. Oh, do come."<br><br>James Purnell looked back over his shoulder and raised his eyebrows in a rather rueful expression at his stocky, sandy-haired friend.<br><br>Lady Madeline Raine was sitting in a window recess in the drawing room of the Earl of Amberley's house on Grosvenor Square. She was holding her two-month-old niece on her lap and gazing down into the child's open eyes. Her twin brother, Lord Eden, the father of the child she held and of its twin, who was sleeping in his own arms, sat with her. They were a little apart from the other occupants of the room and participated both in the general conversation and in their own private one.<br><br>"What a fascination babies are," Madeline said. "Have you noticed, Dom, how a baby will always be the center of attraction in any room?"<br><br>"I have noticed that you have no eyes for anyone but Olivia," he said with a grin, "and occasionally Charles. You have scarcely glanced my way, Mad, even though we have not seen each other for almost two months until today."</p><h2>The Constitution, The Declaration of Independence, and the Articles of Confederation</h2><p>Collected here in one affordable volume are the most important documents of the United States of America: The Constitution of the United States of America, with the Bill of Rights and all of the Amendments; The Declaration of Independence; and the Articles of Confederation.

Major events during his presidency include the Louisiana Purchase (1803) and the Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804-1806)</p><h2>Dwight D. Eisenhower</h2><p><p>An American icon and hero faces a nation-and a world-in transition</p><p>A bona-fide American hero at the close of World War II, General Dwight Eisenhower rode an enormous wave of popularity into the Oval Office seven years later. Though we may view the Eisenhower years through a hazy lens of 1950s nostalgia, historians consider his presidency one of the least successful. At home there was civil rights unrest, McCarthyism, and a deteriorating economy; internationally, the Cold War was deepening. But despite his tendency toward "brinksmanship," Ike would later be revered for "keeping the peace." Still, his actions and policies at the onset of his career, covered by Tom Wicker, would haunt Americans of future generations.</p></p><p>"I have been in politics ... most of my adult life. There's no more active political organization in the world than the armed forces of the United States." So said Dwight Eisenhower, the subject of journalist-novelist Tom Wicker's thoughtful--and often critical--<i>Dwight D. Eisenhower</i>, shortly after leaving the presidency.<p>Eisenhower was never above politics, as his admirers claimed; Wicker shows that he was a political creature through and through, as Patton suspected while serving under him in World War II. ("Ike wants to be president so badly you can taste it," Patton said.) He held all the contradictory positions of a politician, too: a dedicated cold warrior and anti-Communist, he famously decried the power of the "military-industrial complex," resisted American involvement in Vietnam while setting the stage for it, and called himself a "liberal Republican" while doing little to attend to pressing domestic issues, especially in the realm of civil rights. He refused to stand up to Joe McCarthy and chose Richard Nixon as his running mate for reasons of political expediency.</p><p>Wicker gives Eisenhower middling marks: "The worst did not happen in his time, but neither did the best." His survey may not cheer Ike's fans, but it's balanced, highly readable, and useful for those seeking a window on American political life half a century ago. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><p>For over thirty years, <b>Tom Wicker</b> covered American politics at <i>The New York Times</i>, where he began writing the <i>Times's</i> "In the Nation" column.

On one side stand complementarians, arguing the full worth of women but assigning them to differing roles. On the other side stand egalitarians, arguing that the full worth of women demands their equal treatment and access to leadership roles. Is there a way to mend the breach and build consensus? Sarah Sumner thinks there is. Avoiding the pitfalls of both radical feminism and reactionary conservatism, she traces a new path through the issues--biblical, theological, psychological and practical--to establish and affirm common ground. Arguing that men and women are both equal and distinct, Sumner encourages us to find ways to honor and benefit from the leadership gifts of both. <em>Men and Women in the Church</em> is a book for all who want a fresh and hope-filled look at a persistent problem.</p><p>Sarah Sumner (Ph.D., Trinity Evangelical Divinity School) is dean of the A. W. Tozer Theological Seminary in Redding, California. She is also an author and speaker who travels both nationally and internationally to address church congregations and institutions of Christian higher education. In addition, she is a consultant who addresses businesses and nonprofits on the subject of leadership and organizational health. Dr. Sumner is the first woman to earn a Ph.D. in Systematic Theology from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School. Her formal training includes a B.A. from Baylor in Education, an M.A. in Theology from Wheaton College, an M.Div equivalent from Trinity, and an M.B.A. from Azusa Pacific University. For nine years Sumner served as a core teaching pastor at New Song Church in San Dimas, California. For almost thirteen years she worked primarily as a faculty member in the Graduate School of Theology at Azusa Pacific University."I have felt deep need for someone to enter the discussion of gender and leadership in the church and provide some fresh perspectives and new approaches. Dr. Sumner has listened well. Her work is done in the context both of careful scholarship and of personal experience within the evangelical community. And, I believe, she provides an important contribution to the life of the church." (Gregory Waybright, Ph.D., President, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School)<br><br>"Sarah Sumner's practical approach to Scripture offers the church new hope for unity and growth." (Pat Verbal, Founder, Ministry to Today's Child)<br><br>"Dr. Sumner's book is like a fresh breeze from the New Testament, moving clouds of bias and freeing us to look again at the valuable ministry for women in the kingdom of God." (Dr. Barry McMurtrie, Senior Pastor, Crossroads Christian Church, Corona, California, and Chairman, Londen Institute for World Evangelism)<br><br>"Every once in a while someone enters into a theological skirmish and lifts it to a level where rays of biblical sunshine reveal a whole new way of looking at the issue. Honest male readers will repent--at least, I did--of some thoughts. So will honest female readers. And we'll humbly and joyfully explore the new dimension Sarah has helped us see." (Jim Garlow, Senior Pastor, Skyline Wesleyan Church)<br><br>"Sarah's solid biblical approach clarified several issues for me personally. <em>Men Women in the Church</em> is the 'talking point' book on this subject for this generation." (Jim Burns, Ph.D., President, YouthBuilders)<br><br>"This book is a tribute to Sarah Sumner's academic devotion and puts to good use her theological training. Her analysis is fresh and much on the mark. Helga and I are praying that her ministry will have a great and holy impact." (Carl F. H. Henry, Founding Editor of Christianity Today, and author of the 6-volume God, Revelation and Authority)<br><br>"Sarah Sumner's book has the promise to break the divisive deadlock between egalitarians and complementarians that continues to hinder the effectiveness of the church. Sumner's clear, carefully argued message challenges all of us regardless of our position. A must-read for Christian leaders and potential leaders." (Lilian Calles Barger, President of the Damaris Project)<br><br>"This landmark book by theologian Dr. Sarah Sumner is long overdue. I predict this book will engender helpful discussions among concerned Christian leaders for decades to come." (Ted Engstrom, President Emeritus of World Vision International and former President of Youth for Christ International)<br><br>"I've met with hundreds of female students, youth workers and pastors desperate for a balanced biblical view on women in leadership. Finally, we have one." (Kara Powell, Ph.D., Coordinator of Women's Youth Network)<br><br>"Dr. Sumner's <em>Men Women in the Church</em> is one of the most carefully and sensitively written and argued works available on a topic of vital concern for the churches, their leaders and their people in this new millennium. Even among readers who have already taken definite stands, egalitarians can learn modesty, complementarians moderation." (Harold O. J. Brown, John R. Richardson Professor of Theology, Reformed Theological Seminary, Charlotte campus)</p><h2>No Time on My Hands</h2><p>When Grace Snyder, the matriarch of a pioneer Nebraska family, wrote these reminiscences in her eightieth year, she felt she had been blessed "by having no time on my hands." The story of her busy life begins on the high plains of Nebraska, where her parents homesteaded in 1885. She recalls her childhood in a sod house on a frontier that required everyone to pull together in the face of hostile weather, serious illness, and economic depression but that also held its full share of good times. <p>"As a child of seven and up," writes Grace Snyder, ". . . I wished that I might grow up to make the most beautiful quilts in the world, to marry a cowboy, and to look down on the top of a cloud. At the time I dreamed those dreams and wished those wishes, it seemed impossible that any of them could every come true." But she saw all of them realized.</p><p><i>No Time on My Hands</i> is a remarkable chronicle of the sod house era and of Grace Snyder&#x2019;s married life on a ranch in Nebraska&#x2019;s sandhills. From there she finally flies above the clouds to exhibits where her quilts contribute to a worldwide revival of quiltmaking. Mrs. Snyder lived twenty years after the publication of these memoirs in 1963, to the age of one hundred. Her daughter, Nellie Snyder Yost, who helped to write <i>No Time on My Hands</i>, has added an epilogue to this Bison edition.</p></p><p>&#39;No Time on My Hands&#39; is a remarkable chronicle of the sod house era and of Grace Snyder&#39;s married life on a ranch in Nebraska&#39;s sandhills.

This volume can be used for attaining better health, for healing, for gaining extraordinary power, and for spiritual development. This volume consists of five books which covers: - Traditional Chinese Medical theories and qi cultivation methods. - Taoist methods to foster Essence, Qi, and Spirit. - Buddhist Esoteric Abilities of the Body, Speech, and Mind. - Emitting, Absorbing, and Healing Qigong. - Wushu (martial arts) Iron Shirt training. Qigong (Chi Kung) has been an integral part of Chinese culture since ancient China. High level qigong masters have always been respected and held in high esteem in Chinese society. Qi is a Chinese term used to refer to all types of energy. It is the intrinsic substance or the vital force behind all things in the universe. It is the medium between and within all material substances. We are all immersed in it. The term gong refers to the power to produce an effect, an attainment of, or an accomplishment that is achieved with steady practice. Loosely, qigong can be translated as the attainment of qi. Healers and the medical society use qigong for healing and preventing illness. Martial artists use qigong for developing incredible strength and abilities. Others use qigong to attain a greater consciousness.</p><p>Grandmaster Shou-Yu Liang began studying qigong at age 6. He is one of China's top Coaches of Excellence. Master Wen-Ching Wu was a National Grand Champion in both Internal and External Styles of Chinese martial arts. They have coauthored many health, healing, and martial arts related titles. <p>More about Shou-Yu Liang: Shou-Yu Liang was born in 1943 in Sichuan, China. At age six, he began his training in qigong, under the tutelage of his renowned grandfather, the late Liang, Zhi-Xiang. He was taught esoteric qigong and the martial arts of the Emei Mountain region, including Emei Dapeng Qigong. At age eight, his grandfather also made special arrangements for him to begin training Emei Qigong and Wushu with other well-known masters of the time. By the time he was twenty, Shou-Yu Liang had already received instruction from 10 of the most well-known legendary grandmasters of both Southern and Northern systems. His curiosity inspired him to learn more than one hundred sequences from many different styles. As he grew older, through and beyond his college years, his wide background in various martial arts helped form his present character, and led him to achieve a high level of martial arts and qigong skills. Some of the training he concentrated on included: the Emei Styles, Shaolin Long Fist, Praying Mantis, Chuojiao, Qinna, vital point striking, many weapons systems, and qigong methods. Shou-Yu Liang received a university degree in biology and physiology in 1964 then taught high school in a remote village in China. This was part of his reeducation program enforced on him for being born in a bourgeois family, by the government during the political structure of the time. His dedication to his own training and helping others to excel didnt stop during the years he was in the remote village. He began to organize Wushu and wrestling teams to compete in provincial tournaments. During the years of the Cultural Revolution, all forms of martial arts and qigong were suppressed. To avoid conflict with the Red Guards, Shou-Yu Liang left his teaching position and used this opportunity to tour various parts of the country. During his travels, he visited and studied with great masters in Wushu and qigong, and made many friends with people who shared his devotion. His mastery of qigong and martial arts, both technically and philosophically grew to new horizons. Shou-Yu Liang went through numerous provinces and cities, visiting many renowned and revered places where Wushu and qigong originated, was developed, and refined. Among the many places he visited were Emei Mountain, Wudang Mountain, Hua Mountain, Qingcheng Mountain, Chens Village in Henan, the Changzhou Territory in Hebei Province, Beijing, and Shanghai. At the end of the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese government again began to support the martial arts and qigong. During the reorganization and categorizing of the existing martial arts, research projects were set up to seek out living masters and preserve their knowledge. It was at this time that the Sichuan government appointed Shou-Yu Liang as a coach for the city, the territory, and the province. Many of Shou-Yu Liang's students were among the top martial artists of China. In 1979, he received the title of Coach of Excellence since 1949, by the Peoples Republic of China. With his wealth of knowledge, Shou-Yu Liang was inspired at an early age to compete in martial arts tournaments, in which he was many times a noted gold medalist. During his adolescence, Shou-Yu Liang won titles in Chinese wrestling (Shuaijiao), various other martial arts, and weight lifting. After the Cultural Revolution, despite his many official duties Shou-Yu Liang continued to participate actively in competitions both at the provincial and national level. Between 1974 and 1981, he won numerous medals, including four gold medals. His students also performed superbly both in national and provincial open tournaments, winning many medals. Many of these students are now professional Wushu coaches in colleges, in the armed forces, or have become movie stars. In 1979, Shou-Yu Liang received several appointments, including committee membership in the Sichuan Chapter of the Chinese National Wushu Committee and Coaches Committee. In 1981, Shou-Yu Liang visited Seattle, Washington. This trip marked another new era in the course of his life. His ability immediately impressed Wushu devotees. The Wushu and Taiji Club of the Student Association, at the University of Washington, retained him as a Wushu Coach. At the same time, Shou-Yu Liang taught at the Taiji Association in Seattle. In the following year, Shou-Yu Liang went to Vancouver, Canada, and was appointed Taiji Coach by the Villa Cathy Care Home. During the same year, he was appointed Honorary Chairman and Head Coach by the North American Taiji Athletic Association. He also began to teach classes in the Physical Education Department at the University of British Columbia (UBC). In 1984, Shou-Yu Liang was certified as a national First Class Ranking Judge by China. He was also appointed Chairperson and Wushu Coach by the University of British Columbia. In 1985, Shou-Yu Liang was elected coach of the First Canadian National Wushu Team, which was invited to participate in the 1985 World Wushu Invitational Competition that took place in Xian, China. The Canadian team took Third Place after competing against teams from 13 other countries. The next year, Shou-Yu Liang was again elected coach of the Second Canadian National Wushu Team, that competed in the 1986 World Wushu Invitational Competition held in Tianjin, China. A total of 28 countries participated. This time, the Canadian team took Second Place which was only second to China. Shou-Yu Liang and the Canadian success story shocked the Chinese nation, and news of their outstanding accomplishment spread throughout China. In 1994, Shou-Yu Liang led the North American Martial Arts Exhibition Team for a friendship performance tour to ten major cities in China. His team received a warm welcome by the people and government of China. While in China, the team also competed in the International Wushu Competition held in Shanghai. This competition was represented by 32 nations. Shou-Yu Liangs students received 42 gold medals. Canadian premier, Mr. Jean Chretien, also wrote a letter of encouragement to the team. Many Chinese television stations, radio stations, and newspapers spread the news of the Exhibition Team all over China. Since the beginning of the 1960s, Shou-Yu Liang has personally taught over 10,000 students. Additionally, Shou-Yu Liang has touched the lives of tens of thousands of students in his affiliate schools and schools of students students. His students have received hundreds of gold medals in national and international competitions. Many of his students are currently teaching all over the world. Shou-Yu Liang continues to gain recognition in China and abroad. In the past few years, Shou-Yu Liang was selected as The Instructor of the Year by Inside Kung Fu Magazine, selected by the China Wushu Magazine in the Biography of Todays Extraordinary Martial Artists. He has been awarded the Worlds Top 100 Outstanding Martial Artists Professional Award, Worlds Greatest Contribution Award and Worlds Outstanding Accomplishment Award. He has also been selected to be included in the Current List of Famous Martial Artists and in the Chinese Whos Who in the World. The chairman of the China Wushu Association wrote this about him, Uses his martial arts to teach people, and uses his morals to inspire people. Since the beginning of his advantageous martial arts life, he has been featured by scores of newspapers and magazines in China, Europe, the USA, and Canada; as well as, has been interviewed by many television stations in China, the USA, and Canada, including the recent interview by CNN. Currently Shou-Yu Liang is the Advisor or Honorary Advisor of over 20 national and professional Wushu organizations in China, the United States, and Canada. Shou-Yu Liang has written and produced several books and videotapes including, Hsing Yi Chuan, Simplified Tai Chi Chuan with Applications, Baguazhang, Qigong Empowerment, Chinese Fast Wrestling for Fighting, etc. Shou-Yu Liangs popularity increases exponentially every year. It makes him sad to have to refuse invitations to give workshops or attend International and National Wushu competitions. He has to limit himself from traveling too often. The demand for him has become so great that it is taking him away from his commitment to his family, school, and students in Vancouver. His focus is now on his family, friends, and students; and continuing the promotion of Wushu. As he was fortunate enough to learn from his teachers, he is now focusing it on his students, and writing books to preserve what he had the privilege to learn. </p><p>More about Wen-Ching Wu: Wen-Ching Wu was born in Taiwan, China in 1964.

Kroll</b>, Ph.D. (1976), University of Michigan, is Professor of Chinese at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He has published widely on medieval Chinese literature and cultural history.<br>"This is the new standard in a Chinese-English dictionary of classical Chinese, far better than than the older dictionaries that students have too long used. It is a "student's dictionary" that scholars and teachers will find necessary as well. Professor Kroll's long experience, combined with meticulous research and an exceptional precision in the English lexicon, offers a range of definitions, both primary and extended, that give the user a sense of what the word means and how it can be used. The inclusion of the Middle Chinese pronunciation is an immense convenience, immediately showing the student which characters are merely graphic variations for extended usages in a particular frame of reference. His precision in terms of material culture and the natural world is no less welcome." - Stephen Owen, <i>Harvard University</i><br>"This volume is a signal contribution to the field that reflects a truly herculean effort on the part of Professor Kroll and his colleagues. Each entry elucidates finely grained distinctions in meaning, with an especially impressive attention to nuances in the English language that is crucial to making these differences clear. For students of classical and medieval Chinese this dictionary will be indispensable, but even seasoned scholars will find its comprehensive and precise analyses of tremendous value." - Pauline Yu, President, <i>American Council of Learned Societies</i><br>"This dictionary is both helpful and unusual: besides the more common meanings for each entry, it provides the reader with a rich panoply of expressions from the realms of religion (Buddhism, Daoism), medicine and materia medica, as well as cosmology and many other fields. Extremely useful for every student of traditional China, indispensable for the study of early and medieval China." - Michael Lackner, Professor of Sinology, <i>University of Erlangen, Germany</i><br>"This reference work was worth the wait. It will be consulted by seasoned China scholars as well as beginning learners. The definitions of over 8000 primary characters are exact, elegantly concise, and yet complete.

A massive achievement, it will be a tool that no serious student of Chinese language (Classical, Medieval, or even Modern) should do without." - Ronald Egan, <i>Stanford University</i></p><h2>Music in the Western World</h2><p>This classic anthology assembles over 200 source readings, bringing to life the history of music through letters, reviews, biographical sketches, memoirs, and other documents.

I am not quite sure of the exact place or exact date of my birth, but at any rate I suspect I must have been born somewhere and at some time. As nearly as I have been able to learn, I was born near a cross-roads post-office called Hales Ford, and the year was 1858 or 1859. 1 do not know the month or the day. The earliest impressions I can now recall are of the plantation and the slave quarters--the latter being the part of the plantation where the slaves had their cabins.</p><p>My life had its beginning in the midst of the most miserable, desolate, and discouraging surroundings. This was so, however, not because my owners were especially cruel, for they were not, as compared with many other&amp; I was born in a typical log cabin, about fourteen by sixteen feet square. In this cabin I lived with my mother and a brother and sister till after the Civil War, when we were all declared free.</p><p>Of my ancestry I know almost nothing.. In the slave quarters, and even later, I heard whispered conversations among the coloured people of the tortures which the slaves, including, no doubt, my ancestors on my mother's side, suffered in the middle passage of the slave ship while being conveyed from Africa to America. I have been unsuccessful in securing any information that would throw any accurate light upon the history of my family beyond my mother. She, I remember, had a half-brother and a half-sister. In the days of slavery not very much attention was given to family history and family records-that is, black family records. My mother, I suppose, attracted the attention of a purchaser who was afterward my owner and hers. Her addition to the slave family attracted about as much attention as the purchase of a new horse or cow. Of my father I know even less than of my mother. I do not even know his name. I have heard reports to the effect that he was a white man who lived on one of the near-by plantations. Whoever he was, I never heard of his taking the least interest in me or providing in any way for my rearing. But I do not find especial fault with him. He was simply another 'unfortunate victim of the institution which the Nation unhappily had engrafted upon it at that time.</p><p>The cabin was not only our living-place, but was also used as the kitchen for the plantation. My mother was the plantation cook. The cabin was without glass windows; it had only openings in the side which let in the light, and also the cold, chilly air of winter. There was a door to the cabin--that is, something that was called a door--but the uncertain hinges by which it was hung, and the -large cracks in it, to say nothing of the fact that it was too smaIl, made the room a very uncomfortable one. in addition to these openings there was, in the lower right hand corner of the room, the "cat-hole,"--a contrivance which almost every mansion or cabin in Virginia possessed during the ante-bellum period. The "cat-hole" --was a square opening, about seven, by eight inches, provided for the purpose of letting the cat pass in and out of the house at will during the night. In the case of our particular cabin I could never understand the necessity for this convenience, since there were at least a half-dozen other places in the cabin that would have accommodated the cats. There was no wooden floor in our cabin, the naked earth being used as a floor. In the centre of the earthen floor there was a large, deep opening covered with boards, which was used as a place in which to store sweet potatoes during the winter. An impression of this potatohole is very distinctly engraved upon my memory, because I recall that during the process of putting the potatoes in or taking them out I would often come into possession of one or two, which I roasted and thoroughly enjoyed. There was no cooking-stove on our plantation, and an the cooking for the whites and slaves my mother had to do over an open fireplace, mostly in pots and "skillets." While the poorly built cabin caused us to suffer with cold in the winter, the heat from the open fireplace in summer was equally trying.</p><p>The early years of my life, which were spent in the little cabin, were not very different from those of thousands of other slaves. My mother, of course, had little time in which to give attention to the training of her children during the day. She snatched a few moment for our care in the early morning before her work began, and at night after the day's work was done. One of my earliest recollections is that of my mother cooking a chicken late at night, and awakening her children for the purpose of feeding them. How or where she got it I do not know. I presume, however, it was procured from our owner's farm. Some people may can this theft. If such a thing were to happen now, I should condemn it as theft myself. But taking place at the time it did, and for the reason that it did, no one could ever make me believe that my mother was guilty of thieving. She was simply a victim of the system of slavery. I cannot remember having slept in a bed until after our family was declared free by the Emancipation Proclamation. Three children--John, my older brother, Amanda, my sister, and myself--had a pallet on the dirt floor, or, to be more correct, we slept in and on a bundle of filthy rags laid upon the dirt floor.</p></p><h2>The Disappearance of God: A Divine Mystery</h2><p>Friedman probes a chain of mysteries that concern the presence or absence of God, including the connection between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky who each independently developed the idea of the death of God.</p><p>In this bold and illuminating new work, Richard Elliott Friedman probes a chain of mysteries that concern the presence or absence of God. He begins with a fresh, insightful reading of the Hebrew Bible, revealing the profound mystery and significance of the disappearance of God there. Why does the God who is known through miracles and direct interaction at the beginning of the Bible gradually become hidden, leaving humans on their own by the Bible&#39;s end? How is it possible that the Bible, written over so many centuries by so many authors, depicts this diminishing visible presence of God - and the growing up of humankind - so consistently? Why has this not been common knowledge? Friedman then investigates this phenomenon&#39;s place in the formation of Judaism and Christianity.Richard Elliott Friedman is Professor of Hebrew and Comparative Literature and holds the Katzin Chair at the University of California, San Diego.</p><h2>Lives of the Later Caesars: The First Part of the Augustan History, with Newly Compiled Lives of Nerva &amp; Trajan</h2><p>One of the most controversial of all works to survive from ancient Rome, the Augustan History is our main source of information about the Roman emperors from 117 to 284 AD. Written in the late fourth century by an anonymous author, it is an enigmatic combination of truth, invention and humour. This volume contains the first half of the History, and includes biographies of every emperor from Hadrian to Heliogabalus - among them the godlike Marcus Antonius and his grotesquely corrupt son Commodus. The History contains many fictitious (but highly entertaining) anecdotes about the depravity of the emperors, as the author blends historical fact and faked documents to present our most complete - albeit unreliable - account of the later Roman Caesars.&nbsp;<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Hoffmann (1776-1822) was perhaps one of the two or three greatest of all writers of fantasy. His wonderful tales, translated into many languages and adapted into numerous stage works, have delighted readers for a century and a half. <br>They open our eyes to an extraordinary world of fantasy, poetry, and the supernatural. Remarkable characters come vividly to life. With exciting speed, Hoffmann moves from the firm ground of reality to ambiguity, mystery, and romance. His imaginativeness is unsurpassed, and his handling of allegory, symbolism, and mysticism is unusually skillful. These qualities make his tales some of the most stimulating and enjoyable in the world's literature. They can be read on many levels of enjoyment; as exciting fiction brilliantly told, as a fascinating statement of many of the major concerns of the Romantic era, and as a culmination of German Romantic literature. <br>This collection contains ten of his best tales: "The Golden Flower Pot," "Automata," "A New Year's Eve Adventure," "Nutcracker and the King of Mice," "The Sand-Man," "Rath Krespel," "Tobias Martin, Master Cooper, and His Men," "The Mines of Falun," "Signor Formica," and "The King's Betrothed."</p><p></p><h2>Great River: The Rio Grande in North American History.

Published anonymously in 1776, six months before the Declaration of Independence,&nbsp;<i>Common Sense</i>&nbsp;was a radical and impassioned call for America to free itself and set up an independent republican government. Savagely attacking hereditary kingship and aristocratic institutions, Paine urged a new beginning for his adopted country in which personal freedom and social equality would be upheld and economic and cultural progress encouraged. His pamphlet was the first to speak directly to a mass audience&#x2014;it went through fifty-six editions within a year of publication&#x2014;and its assertive and often caustic style embodied the democratic spirit he advocated.</p></p><p>"These are the times that try men's souls," begins Thomas Paine's first Crisis paper, the impassioned pamphlet that helped ignite the American Revolution. Published in Philadelphia in January of 1776, <i>Common Sense</i> sold 150,000 copies almost immediately. A powerful piece of propaganda, it attacked the idea of a hereditary monarchy, dismissed the chance for reconciliation with England, and outlined the economic benefits of independence while espousing equality of rights among citizens. Paine fanned a flame that was already burning, but many historians argue that his work unified dissenting voices and persuaded patriots that the American Revolution was not only necessary, but an epochal step in world history.The Library of America is an award-winning, nonprofit program dedicated to publishing America&#39;s best and most significant writing in handsome, enduring volumes, featuring authoritative texts.

Riding through France with his master, the servant Jacques appears to act as though he is truly free in a world of dizzying variety and unpredictability. Characters emerge and disappear as the pair travel across the country, and tales begin and are submerged by greater stories, to reveal a panoramic view of eighteenth-century society. But while Jacques seems to choose his own path, he remains convinced of one philosophical belief: that every decision he makes, however whimsical, is wholly predetermined.

After graduating in Paris in 1732, he was nominally a law student for ten years, but was actually leading a precarious bohemian but studious existence. In the early 1740s he met three contemporaries who were of great significance to him and to the age: a&#39;Alembert, Condillac and Rousseau, who assisted Diderot in the compilation of the Encyclopedie, which he worked on until its completion in 1773. Interested in the mind-body dichotomy, his work was a bold mixture of science and philosophy. He died in 1784.

If you disagree, then it's been too long since you've attended a wild rumpus. Max dons his wolf suit in pursuit of some mischief and gets sent to bed without supper. Fortuitously, a forest grows in his room, allowing his wild rampage to continue unimpaired. Sendak's color illustrations (perhaps his finest) are beautiful, and each turn of the page brings the discovery of a new wonder. <p> The wild things--with their mismatched parts and giant eyes--manage somehow to be scary-looking without ever really being scary; at times they're downright hilarious. Sendak's defiantly run-on sentences--one of his trademarks--lend the perfect touch of stream of consciousness to the tale, which floats between the land of dreams and a child's imagination. </p><p> This Sendak classic is more fun than you've ever had in a wolf suit, and it manages to reaffirm the notion that there's no place like home.</p><p>Fiftieth Anniversary Edition</p><p><em>Where the Wild Things Are</em></p><p>Winner of the 1964 Caldecott Medal for the Most Distinguished Picture Book of the Year</p><p>The original pictures have never before been as faithfully reproduced as they are in this new edition.

Circumstances lead to a brother and sister, Edgar and Marybelle, being initiated into the clan too young, and therefore doomed to live out eternity forever on the brink of adulthood, until a wooden stake or a silver bullet should cut them down.

Poetry, patterns like Pascal's triangle, philosophy, psychology, music, and dozens of simple mathematical figures are enlisted to show that the "divine proportion" or "golden ratio" is a feature of geometry and analysis which awakes answering echoes in the human psyche. When we judge a work of art aesthetically satisfying, according to his formulation, we are making it conform to a pattern whose outline is laid down in simple geometrical figures; and it is the analysis of these figures which forms the core of Professor Huntley's book.<br>For the philosopher, scientist, poet, art historian, music listener, artist, as well as the general reader who wants to understand more about the fascinating properties of numbers, this is a beautifully written, exciting account of the search for a naturally manifested aesthetic that has occupied man since he first asked the question "why?"<br>"This is a delightful book to read. . . . It wanders here and there through some of the most attractive byways of simple mathematics, returning always to the oddities and pleasures of the golden section.

In this unique book, Alice Starmore leads us into the realm of glamourie and &#x2014; like the witches of Gaelic folklore &#x2014; casts spells with needles and a single thread. Taking her daughter Jade's supernatural stories as inspiration, she uses the art of hand knitting to bewitch and bedazzle, and illustrates the tales with elaborate costumes and accessories that portray fanciful and extraordinary ideas. <br> In creating these costumes, she has powerfully demonstrated the glamourie that can flow from the twin wands of a master magician.<br> While the first half of this book is an unrestrained flight of fancy, the second half contains full instructions for knitting simpler and more practical garments inspired by each costume, all written with Alice Starmore's trademark accuracy and precision. <br> By developing each of these patterns from its associated costume, she has revealed how her mind works and how her imagination led her from the initial inspiration through to the final design.<br> Alice and Jade Starmore are from the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, and its moody Celtic landscape is the backdrop to the stories, costumes and designs they have created. The final stage of <i>Glamourie</i> was to take their creations back out into that landscape to be photographed. They trekked to special locations, far off the beaten track, and Jade's spectacular photographs depict both the sweeping panorama and the minute detail of their beloved native isle. Three years in the making, this combination of photography and fable, of highly conceptual design and practical instruction, will enchant not only knitters but also those in the fashion and costume world and readers fascinated by Scottish and Gaelic legends.</p></p><p>An acclaimed textile designer, author, artist, and photographer, Alice Starmore is a native of Scotland's Isle of Lewis.

It was a terrible thought. Her country's leader had called sparrows the enemy of the farmers--they were eating too much grain, he said. He announced a great "Sparrow War" to banish them from China, but Ming-Li did not want to chase the birds away. <br>As the people of her village gathered with firecrackers and gongs to scatter the sparrows, Ming-Li held her ears and watched in dismay. The birds were falling from the trees, frightened to death! Ming-Li knew she had to do something--even if she couldn't stop the noise. Quietly, she vowed to save as many sparrows as she could, one by one...</p><p>Sara Pennypacker is the author of the acclaimed Clementine series, illustrated by Marla Frazee;<i> Stuart's </i><i>Cape</i><i> </i>and<em> Stuart Goes to School, </em>both illustrated by Martin Matje; and <em>Dumbstruck</em>. Sara lives in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.<br>Yoko Tanaka made her children's book debut with <em>Theodosia and the Serpents of Chaos</em> by R.L. LaFevers. Before graduating from Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, Yoko won a Gold Award from the Society of Illustrators in Los Angeles. Her work has been featured in several magazines, and in galleries across the globe. <em>Sparrow Girl</em> is her first picture book.Ming-Li is the youngest member of a farming family in China, and she's distressed when the country declares war on sparrows in an attempt to save the grain fields from the birds' depredations. As the villagers raise a clamor to drive the sparrows away from perches, the dead and dying birds drop to the ground. Even more concerned after her older brother's pet pigeon becomes one of the victims, Ming-Li convinces her brother to help her in rescuing the few sparrows who've survived their fall ("Seven sparrows," she says sadly. "When there used to be thousands"), tending them and hiding them through the winter; in the spring, the villagers discover their crops overrun by the pests the sparrows would formerly have eaten, and Ming-Li's secretly saved flock becomes the miracle that brings better days. This is a tender story smoothly told, based on China's misguided 1958 attempt to eradicate sparrows, and audiences will appreciate the heroism of the young protagonist. The relentless mowing down of the sparrows makes the account rather harrowing for its likely audience, though, and the story will leave them with a lot of questions, such as how noise kills the birds and how a mere seven sparrows can do the job of the lost flocks; the end, wherein Ming-Li's father proclaims Ming-Li a real farmer, is more random than satisfying. The illustrations have a smoothly grainy sweep that suggests oil pastels, and the controlled regularity of the modeling results in interestingly stylized scenes; the intricate and lovely sparrows, looking like delicate woodcrafting, stand out against the subdued background hues of misty landscape and dark barn. The combination distances the events somewhat (which may be for the better at its most heart-rending moments), but it's an original and elegant look. This might make for an unusual but dramatic addition to a unit on ecology, or it could simply provide listeners with a thoughtful example of youthful activism. A brief historical note is included. BCCB"<br><br>The so-called Sparrow War, declared by Mao in 1958, furnishes the basis for this grim story. Deciding that sparrows are eating too much grain, "our Leader" orders his people to drive them away, and Ming-Li's whole village turns out to "[make] so much noise the ground itself rumble[s]." Ming-Li objects, pointing out that other birds will leave along with the sparrows, but she is silenced; on her own, she creates a bird refuge in an abandoned barn and becomes a heroine the following year, when the birds are needed to control worms, grasshoppers and other pests. Fans hoping for the insouciance of Pennypacker's Clementine will look in vain; Ming-Li's determination rises up against the frightening images of marauding villagers and of dead birds raining from the sky. Debut artist Tanaka contributes skillful but unsettling pictures-her overcast palette, skewed perspectives and stylized faces create the atmosphere of a bad dream. PW"<br><br>In this sober tale based on Mao Zedong's 1958 edict to eradicate China's sparrows to prevent crop damage, a compassionate little girl follows her heart instead of her Leader. When Ming-Li learns of Mao's plan to eliminate the sparrows by creating noise for three consecutive days, she prophetically fears the terrible din will kill all birds. As mindless mobs beat drums, clang gongs, crash cymbals and explode firecrackers, Ming-Li's worst fears are realized, but not before she hides seven sparrows, which she feeds and tends in secret. When spring arrives and shocked farmers watch helplessly as locusts decimate their crops, Ming-Li reveals her secret and saves her village from famine. Tanaka's quiet, simple illustrations in subdued tones match the somber mood. In her red suit, Ming-Li's solitary figure stands out from the villagers in their uniform blue jackets, reinforcing her individuality. Moving images, such as a double-page spread of dead sparrows falling like "teardrops" while a weeping Ming-Li cradles a limp bird, send a powerful message that one small person can make a big difference.

She was born poor, and at the first sign that she could earn money, her parents grabbed the reins and the checks. Widowed at twenty-four, Mary Astor was looking for stability when she met and wed Dr. Franklyn Thorpe. But the marriage was rocky from the start; both were unfaithful, but they did not divorce until after Mary Astor gave birth to little Marylyn Thorpe.<br><br> What followed was a custody battle that pushed The Spanish Civil War and Hitler&#x2019;s 1936 Olympic Games off of the front pages all over America. Astor and Thorpe were both ruthless in their fight to gain custody of their daughter, but Thorpe held a trump card: the diaries that Mary Astor had been keeping for years. In these diaries, Astor detailed her own affairs as well as the myriad dalliances of some of Hollywood&#x2019;s biggest names. The studio heads, longtime controllers of public perception, were desperate to keep such juicy details from leaking. <br><br> With the complete support of the Astor family, including unlimited access to the photographs and memorabilia of Mary Astor&#x2019;s estate, <i>The Purple Diaries</i> is a look at Hollywood&#x2019;s Golden Age as it has never been seen before, as Egan spins a wildly absorbing yarn about a scandal that threatened to bring down the dream factory known as Hollywood.</p><p>Joseph Egan is something of a renaissance figure.

Driving home through a swirling blizzard late one night, the couple skids off the road. Near the sight of their accident they discover a dead body. To her horror, Julia recognizes the body as a prominent academic and one of her former lovers. In the wake of the death, the icy veneer of their town Elm Harbor, a place Julie calls &#34;the heart of whiteness,&#34; begins to crack, having devastating consequences for a prominent local family and sending shock waves all the way to the White House.</p><p><b>Stephen L.

He and his family live near New Haven, Connecticut.<b>Chapter One: Shortcut</b>(I)On Friday the cat disappeared, the White House phoned, and Jeannie&#x2019;s fever&#x2014;said the sitter when Julia called from the echoing marble lobby of Lombard Hall, where she and her husband were f�ting shadowy alumni, one or two facing indictment, whose only virtue was piles of money&#x2014;hit 103. After that, things got worser faster, as her grandmother used to say, although Granny Vee&#x2019;s Harlem locutions, shaped to the rhythm of an era when the race possessed a stylish sense of humor about itself, would not have gone over well in the Landing, and Julia Carlyle had long schooled herself to avoid them.The cat was the smallest problem, even if later it turned out to be a portent. Rainbow Coalition, the children&#x2019;s smelly feline mutt, had vanished before and usually came back, but now and then stayed away and was dutifully replaced by another dreadful creature of the same name. The White House was another matter. Lemaster&#x2019;s college roommate, now residing in the Oval Office, telephoned at least once a month, usually to shoot the breeze, a thing it had never before occurred to Julia that Presidents of the United States did. As to Jeannie, well, the child was a solid eight years into a feverish childhood, the youngest of four, and her mother knew by now not to rush home at each spike of the thermometer. Tylenol and cool compresses had so far defeated every virus that had dared attack her child and would stymie this one, too. Julia gave the sitter her marching orders and returned to the endless dinner in time for Lemaster&#x2019;s closing jokes. It was eleven minutes before ten on the second Friday in November in the year of our Lord 2003. Outside Lombard Hall, the snow had arrived early, two inches on the ground and more expected. As the police later would reconstruct the night&#x2019;s events, Professor Kellen Zant was already dead and on the way to town in his car.(II)After. Big cushy flakes still falling. Julia and Lemaster were barreling along Four Mile Road in their Cadillac Escalade with all the extras, color regulation black, as befitted their role as the most celebrated couple in African America&#x2019;s lonely Harbor County outpost. That, at least, was how Julia saw them, even after the family&#x2019;s move six years ago out into what clever Lemaster called &#x201c;the heart of whiteness.&#x201d; For most of their marriage they had lived in Elm Harbor, largest city in the county and home of the university her husband now led. By now they should have moved back, but the drafty old mansion the school set aside for its president was undergoing renovation, a firm condition Lemaster had placed on his acceptance of the post. The trustees had worried about how it would look to spend so much on a residence at a time when funds to fix the classrooms were difficult to raise, but Lemaster, as always with his public, had been at once reasonable and adamant. &#x201c;People value you more,&#x201d; he had explained to his wife, &#x201c;if it costs more to get you than they expected.&#x201d;&#x201c;Or they hate you for it,&#x201d; Julia had objected, but Lemaster stood his ground; for, within the family, he was a typical West Indian male, and therefore merely adamant.They drove. Huge flakes swirled toward the windshield, the soft, chunky variety that signals to any New Englander that the storm is moving slowly and the eye is yet to come. Julia sulked against the dark leather, steaming with embarrassment, having called two of the alums by each other&#x2019;s names, and having referred half the night to a wife named Carlotta as Charlotte, who then encouraged her, in that rich Yankee way, not to worry about it, dear, it&#x2019;s a common mistake. Lemaster, who had never forgotten a name in his life, charmed everybody into smiling, but as anyone who has tried to raise money from the wealthy knows, a tiny sliver of offense can cut a potential gift by half or more, and in this crowd, half might mean eight figures.Julia said, &#x201c;Vanessa&#x2019;s not setting fires any more.&#x201d; Vanessa, a high-school senior, being the second of their four children. The first and the third&#x2014;their two boys&#x2014;were both away at school.Her husband said, &#x201c;Thank you for tonight.&#x201d;&#x201c;Did you hear what I said?&#x201d;&#x201c;I did, my love.&#x201d; The words rapid and skeptical, rich with that teasing, not-quite-British lilt. &#x201c;Did you hear what I said?&#x201d; Turning lightly but swiftly to avoid a darting animal. &#x201c;I know you hate these things. I promise to burden you with as few as possible.&#x201d;&#x201c;Oh, Lemmie, come on. I was awful. You&#x2019;ll raise more money if you leave me behind.&#x201d;&#x201c;Wrong, Jules. Cameron Knowland told me he so enjoyed your company that he&#x2019;s upping his pledge by five million.&#x201d;Julia in one of her moods, reassurance the last thing she craved. Clever wind whipped the snow into concentric circles of whiteness in the headlights, creating the illusion that the massive car was being drawn downward into a funnel. Four Mile Road was not the quickest route home from the city, but the Carlyles were planning a detour to the multiplex to pick up their second child, out for the first time in a while with her boyfriend, &#x201c;That Casey,&#x201d; as Lemaster called him. The GPS screen on the dashboard showed them well off the road, meaning the computer had never heard of Four Mile, which did not, officially, exist. But Lemaster would not forsake a beloved shortcut, even in a storm, and unmapped country lanes were his favorite.&#x201c;Cameron Knowland,&#x201d; Julia said distinctly, &#x201c;is a pig.&#x201d; Her husband waited. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad the SEC people are after him. I hope he goes to jail.&#x201d;&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t Cameron, Jules, it&#x2019;s his company.&#x201d; Lemaster&#x2019;s favorite tone of light, donnish correction, which she had once, long ago, loved. &#x201c;The most that would be imposed is a civil fine.&#x201d;&#x201c;All I know is, he kept looking down my dress.&#x201d;&#x201c;You should have slapped his face.&#x201d; She turned in surprise, and what felt distantly like gratitude. Lemaster laughed. &#x201c;Cameron would have taken his pledge back, but Carlotta would have doubled it.&#x201d;A brief marital silence, Julia painfully aware that tonight she had entirely misplaced the delicate, not-quite-flirty insouciance that had made her, a quarter-century ago, the most popular girl at her New Hampshire high school. Like her husband, she was of something less than average height. Her skin was many shades lighter than his blue-black, for her unknown father had been, as Lemaster insisted on calling him, a Caucasian. Her gray eyes were strangely large for a woman of her diminutive stature. Her slightly jutting jaw was softened by an endearing dimple. Her lips were alluringly crooked. When she smiled, the left side of her wide mouth rose a little farther than the right, a signal, her husband liked to say, of her quietly liberal politics. She was by reputation an easy person to like. But there were days when it all felt false, and forced. Being around the campus did that to her. She had been a deputy dean of the divinity school for almost three years before Lemaster was brought back from Washington to run the university, and her husband&#x2019;s ascension had somehow increased her sense of not belonging. Julia and the children had remained in the Landing during her husband&#x2019;s year and a half as White House counsel. Lemaster had spent as many weekends as he could at home. People invented delicious rumors to explain his absence, none of them true, but as Granny Vee used to say, the truth only matters if you want it to.&#x201c;You&#x2019;re so silly,&#x201d; she said, although, to her frequent distress, her husband was anything but. She looked out the window. Slickly whitened trees slipped past, mostly conifers. It was early for snow, not yet winter, not yet anything, really: that long season of pre-Thanksgiving New England chill when the stores declared it Christmas season but everybody else only knew it was cold. Julia had spent most of her childhood in Hanover, New Hampshire, where her mother had been a professor at Dartmouth, and she was accustomed to early snow, but this was ridiculous. She said, &#x201c;Can we talk about Vanessa?&#x201d;&#x201c;What about her?&#x201d;&#x201c;The fires. It&#x2019;s all over with, Lemmie.&#x201d;A pause. Lemaster played with the satellite radio, switching, without asking, from her adored Broadway show tunes&#x2014;Granny Vee had loved them, so she did, too&#x2014;to his own secret passion, the more rebellious and edgy and less commercial end of the hip-hop spectrum. The screen informed her in glowing green letters that the furious sexual bombast now assaulting her eardrums from nine speakers was something called Goodie Mobb. &#x201c;How do you know it&#x2019;s over?&#x201d; he asked.&#x201c;Well, for one thing, she hasn&#x2019;t done it in a year. For another, Dr. Brady says so.&#x201d;&#x201c;Nine months,&#x201d; said Lemaster, precisely. &#x201c;And she&#x2019;s not Vincent Brady&#x2019;s daughter,&#x201d; he added, slender fingers tightening ever so slightly on the wheel, but in caution, not anger, for the weather had slipped from abhorrent to atrocious. She glanced his way, turning down the throbbing music just in case, for a change, he wanted to talk, but he was craning forward, hoping for a better view, heavy flakes now falling faster than the wipers could clean. He wore glasses with steel rims. His goatee and mustache were so perfectly trimmed they might have been invisible against his smooth ebon flesh, except for the thousand flecks of gray that reshaped to follow the motion of his jaw whenever he spoke. &#x201c;What a mistake,&#x201d; said Lemaster, but it took Julia a second to work out that he was referring to the psychiatrist, and not one among the many enemies he had effortlessly, and surprisingly, collected during his six months as head of the university.Julia had been stunned when the judge ordered the choice of intensive therapy or a jail sentence. Vanessa cheerily offered to do the time&#x2014; &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t say I haven&#x2019;t earned it&#x201d;&#x2014;but Julia, who used to volunteer at the juvenile detention facility in the city, knew what it was like. She could not imagine her vague, brainy, artistic daughter surviving two days among the hard-shelled teens scooped off the street corners and dumped there. As her grandmother used to say, there are our black people and there are other black people&#x2014;and all her life Julia had secretly believed it. So Lemaster had chosen Brady, a professor at the medical school who was supposed to be one of the best adolescent psychiatrists in the country, and Julia, who, like Vanessa, would have preferred a woman, or at least someone from within the darker nation, held her peace. She had never imagined, twenty years ago, growing into the sort of wife who would.She had never imagined a lot of things.&#x201c;Cameron told me something interesting,&#x201d; said Lemaster when he decided she had stewed long enough. They passed two gray horses in a paddock, wearing blankets against the weather but not otherwise concerned, watching the sparse nighttime traffic with their shining eyes. &#x201c;He had the strangest call a couple of weeks ago.&#x201d; That confident, can-do laugh, a hand lifted from the wheel in emphasis, a gleeful glance in Julia&#x2019;s direction. Lemaster loved being one up on anyone in the vicinity, and made no exception for his own wife. &#x201c;From an old friend of yours, as a matter of fact. Apparently&#x2014;&#x201d;&#x201c;Lemmie, look out! <i>Look out!</i>&#x201d;Too late.(III)Every New Englander knows that nighttime snowy woods are noisy. Chittering, sneaking animals, whistling, teasing wind, cracking, creaking branches&#x2014;there is plenty to hear, except when your Escalade is in a ditch, the engine hissing and missing, hissing and missing, and Goodie Mobb still yallowing from nine speakers. Julia pried herself from behind the air bag, her husband&#x2019;s outstretched hand ready to help. Shivering, she looked up and down the indentation in the snow that marked Four Mile Road. Lemaster had his hands on her face. Confused, she slapped them away. He patiently turned her back to look at him. She realized that he was asking if she was all right. There was blood on his forehead and in his mouth, a lot of it. Her turn to ask how he was doing, and his turn to reassure her.No cell-phone service out here: they both tried.&#x201c;What do we do now?&#x201d; said Julia, shivering for any number of good reasons. She tried to decide whether to be angry at him for taking his eyes off the road just before a sharp bend that had not budged in their six years of living out here.&#x201c;We wait for the next car to come by.&#x201d;&#x201c;Nobody drives this way but you.&#x201d;Lemaster was out of the ditch, up on the road. &#x201c;We drove ten minutes and passed two cars. Another one will be along in a bit.&#x201d; He paused and, for a wretched moment, she feared he might be calculating the precise moment when the next was expected. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll leave the headlights on. The next car will see us and slow down.&#x201d; His voice was calm, as calm as the day the President asked him to come down to Washington and, as a pillar of integrity, clean up the latest mess in the White House; as calm as the night two decades ago when Julia told him she was pregnant and he answered without excitement or reproach that they must marry. Moral life, Lemaster often said, required reason more than passion. Maybe so, but too much reason could drive you nuts. &#x201c;You should wait in the car. It&#x2019;s cold out here.&#x201d;&#x201c;What about Vanessa? She&#x2019;s waiting for us to pick her up.&#x201d;&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll wait.&#x201d;Julia, uncertain, did as her husband suggested. He was eight years her senior, a difference that had once provided her a certain assurance but in recent years had left her feeling more and more that he treated her like a child. Granny Vee used to say that if you married a man because you wanted him to take care of you, you ran the risk that he would. About to climb into the warmth of the car, she spotted by moonlight a ragged bundle in the ditch a few yards away. She took half a step toward it, and a pair of feral creatures with glowing eyes jerked furry heads up from their meal and scurried into the trees. A deer, she decided, the dark mound mostly covered with snow, probably struck by a car and thrown into the ditch, transformed into dinner for whatever animals refused to hibernate. Shivering, she buttoned her coat, then turned back toward the Escalade. She did not need a close look at some bloodstained animal with the most succulent pieces missing. Only once she had her hand on the door handle did she stop.Deer, she reminded herself, rarely wear shoes.</p><h2>The Ship of Dreams: The Sinking of the Titanic and the End of the Edwardian Era</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Gareth Russell has chosen a handful of passengers on the doomed liner and by training a spotlight on every detail of their lives, he has given us a meticulous, sensitive, and at times harsh picture of the early 20th century in Britain and America.

Within a week of setting sail, they were all caught up in the horrifying disaster of the <i>Titanic</i>&#x2019;s sinking, one of the biggest news stories of the century. Today, we can see their stories and the <i>Titanic</i>&#x2019;s voyage as the beginning of the end of the established hierarchy of the Edwardian era.<br> <br> Writing in his elegant signature prose and using previously unpublished sources, deck plans, journal entries, and surviving artifacts, Gareth Russell peers through the portholes of these first-class travelers to immerse us in a time of unprecedented change in British and American history. Through their intertwining lives, he examines social, technological, political, and economic forces such as the nuances of the British class system, the explosion of competition in the shipping trade, the birth of the movie industry, the Irish Home Rule Crisis, and the Jewish-American immigrant experience while also recounting their intimate stories of bravery, tragedy, and selflessness.<br> <br> Masterful in its superb grasp of the forces of history, gripping in its moment-by-moment account of the sinking, revelatory in discounting long-held myths, and lavishly illustrated with color and black and white photographs, this absorbing, accessible, and authoritative account of the <i>Titanic</i>&#x2019;s life and death is destined to become the definitive book on the subject.</p><p>Educated at Oxford University and Queens University, Belfast, Gareth Russell is a historian, novelist, and playwright.

The minister of the local Church of Scotland drew his salary from the Earl&#x2019;s coffers. So complete was the Leslie family&#x2019;s influence in this part of eastern Scotland that the parish&#x2019;s ancient recorded name of Fetkill had faded to become the parish of Leslie.<br> <br>It had been predominantly a benign local absolutism. When an amateur historian arrived in Leslie in the 1830s, in the hope of unearthing grisly anecdotes from the village archives, he was, in his own words, distressed to find &#x201c;nothing generally interesting in them,&#x201d; with no perceptible drama having occurred in Leslie over the course of the last three hundred years. The eight-hundred-seat chapel was built; the flax mills spun; whiskey houses and inns were opened, closed, and renamed; and local legend had it that King James V had written his poem &#x201c;Christ&#x2019;s Kirk on the Green,&#x201d; in celebration of a Caledonian pastoral idyll, after his hunting trip near the village in the 1530s.1<br> <br>As the Edwardian era drew to its close, the then Countess of Rothes, Lucy No�lle Martha Leslie, had busied herself with the renovation and preservation of Leslie House. Given the spiraling cost of maintaining a stately home, expansion, in the hope of restoring the house to what it had been in the previous centuries, would have been financially lunatic, although even at that the young Countess had sunk nearly �11,000 of her natal family&#x2019;s money into the preservation and beautification of her husband&#x2019;s ancestral home.2 She had married into the Leslie family on a &#x201c;delightfully bright and genial&#x201d; day in 1900, with a service at St. Mary Abbots Church in Kensington, near the London townhouse of her parents where the future countess had been born on Christmas Day twenty-two years earlier.3 Christ&#x2019;s Nativity gave Lucy Dyer-Edwardes the first of her two middle names, No�l (the spelling on her birth certificate, but commonly spelled in Society columns and by various relatives as No�lle); the other was Martha. These names and spellings were used variably throughout her life, although by adulthood she increasingly seemed to prefer her middle name of No�lle. Her education had been entrusted to governesses and tutors who moved with the family as they oscillated between the Kensington house, their ch�teau in Normandy, and their favorite home, Prinknash Park, the Dyer-Edwardeses&#x2019; country seat in Gloucestershire. Prinknash, pronounced &#x201c;Prinnage&#x201d; as one of the thousands of anti-phonetic nomenclatures that form the pleasurable minefield of English place-names, was originally a Benedictine monastery founded, with spectacularly poor luck on the order&#x2019;s part, only thirteen years before England&#x2019;s break with Rome. Secularized and sold by the Tudors, Prinknash Park had become a beautiful stately pile in idyllic countryside, where No�lle&#x2019;s father, Thomas, was free to pursue his fascination with his home&#x2019;s long-dead original owners and, bit by bit, their Catholic faith, to the distress of his wife, who regarded the Church of Rome as a foreigner&#x2019;s creed.4<br> <br>An only child and thus sole heiress to a substantial fortune, No�lle also had the added benefit of blossoming into what one family member called &#x201c;a true English rose beauty&#x201d; by the time she turned eighteen and could be launched into the ballrooms and on to the marriage market of the upper classes as part of the debutante Season. After a formal presentation at Buckingham Palace, which marked their &#x201c;coming out&#x201d; into Society, the debutantes were, in the words of an Irish peer&#x2019;s daughter, paraded &#x201c;to shooting and tennis parties, polo matches, tea with the Viceroy in Dublin,&#x201d; or, in No�lle&#x2019;s case, with the who&#x2019;s who of the London beau monde.5 The ultimate goal of this whirlwind of merrymaking was a wedding announcement in <i>The Times</i>, but although No�lle was a popular &#x201c;deb,&#x201d; she resisted many of the offers of marriage that came her way until she met Norman Leslie, 19th Earl of Rothes, an infantry officer with a &#x201c;pleasant face and manners,&#x201d; who proposed to her in 1899.6<br> <br> <br>The Countess of Rothes, shortly after her marriage.<br><br>Married the following spring in &#x201c;a pretty gown of white satin covered with exquisite Brussels lace&#x201d; and carrying a bouquet of carnations and white heather, No�lle honeymooned on the Isle of Wight, before returning to London for her first audience at Court as the new Countess of Rothes.7 A young, wealthy, and good-looking couple, who were clearly very much in love, the Rotheses became a fixture in Society columns. The aristocracy were obsessive points of interest for the British, and certain sections of the American, press&#x2014;the &#x201c;beautiful people&#x201d; of the era, according to a critical study of their long decline.8 It made the press&#x2019;s job easier when, like No�lle, the subject actually was physically beautiful, with even the <i>Washington Post</i> informing its readers, three thousand miles away, that on her second trip to Buckingham Palace, when she curtseyed to the Princess of Wales for the first time as a countess, No�lle was, by general agreement, &#x201c;one of the most beautiful young women seen at the Court this season.&#x201d;9<br> <br>After their honeymoon, the newlyweds had spent most of their time at the Rotheses&#x2019; country house in Devonshire and their mansion in Chelsea, where their first son, Malcolm, was born on February 8, 1902, and the couple attended King Edward VII&#x2019;s coronation in the capital on August 9 of that year. By the time their second son, John, was born in December 1909, the death of Norman&#x2019;s great-uncle had freed up Leslie House for their use and No�lle was enraptured with her husband&#x2019;s fiefdom. With the piqued pride of a jilted friend who cannot quite believe the world exists beyond the sparkle of London, the <i>Bystander</i> reported that the Countess of Rothes, who had been the toast of the capital at the time of Edward VII&#x2019;s accession, was now &#x201c;so devoted to her Scottish home, Leslie House, that neither she nor Lord Rothes are often to be seen in London or anywhere else [where] the world of amusement foregathers.&#x201d;10 A journalist from the <i>Scotsman</i> observed that within a few years of her residency at Leslie House &#x201c;not a Christmastide passed but the Countess celebrated her birthday, Dec. 25, by treating all the children in the parish to an entertainment in Leslie Town Hall, and presenting each with a Christmas gift.&#x201d;11 Convinced of the benefits created by clean air, No�lle organized trips for young women employed in local factories to visit the beach or the countryside. She funded the creation of Fife&#x2019;s first ambulance corps, the Countess of Rothes Voluntary Aid Detachment, she paid for the neighboring parish of Kinglassie&#x2019;s first clinic, organized parties to raise money for veterans from her husband&#x2019;s regiment, and two years after John&#x2019;s birth she began training with the Red Cross as a nurse.<br> <br>Despite the <i>Bystander</i>&#x2019;s gripes, London was not quite abandoned by the Rotheses and No�lle often returned for the Season. She joined the committee that organized the Royal Caledonian Ball, an annual highlight for the capital&#x2019;s socialites with its insistence on proper Highland attire and music. The funds raised were channeled to the Royal Caledonian Educational Trust&#x2019;s care for Scottish orphanages.12 She worked for the YMCA Bazaar and the Children&#x2019;s Guild; she sat on the foundation boards for the Randolph Wemyss Memorial Hospital and the Queen Victoria School near Edinburgh, which taught the sons of Scottish military personnel, and her passion for preserving a rural way of life in Britain brought her to serve the Village Clubs Association. The young Countess&#x2019;s charitable activities were a mixture of the more glittering variety of philanthropy and intense hands-on work, and the former solidified many of her relationships with fellow like-minded aristocrats&#x2014;Evelyn Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire; Consuelo Spencer-Churchill (n�e Vanderbilt), Duchess of Marlborough; Kathleen Wellesley, Duchess of Wellington; and Constance Sackville, the Dowager Countess De La Warr, became close friends. With Millicent Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland, No�lle helped raise a substantial amount of money for the National Milk Hostels&#x2019; quest to provide &#x201c;wholesome milk for poor families,&#x201d; through a series of Society masquerade balls and garden parties, at which tickets were costly and donations firmly encouraged.13<br> <br>One of No�lle&#x2019;s philanthropic connections was Louise, Duchess of Fife, who alone of King Edward VII&#x2019;s daughters had married into the native aristocracy.14 Through her, No�lle met, and was sincerely liked by, King Edward&#x2019;s daughter-in-law Mary, Princess of Wales. Her friendships within the Royal Family added a personal affection to the feudal obligations that brought Norman and No�lle to most major state occasions, including the funeral of Edward VII, after his death at Buckingham Palace was announced on May 6, 1910. Over the course of the next three days, a quarter of a million people filed past the royal coffin to pay their respects. Despite a reign of only nine years, Edward VII had, in his Foreign Secretary&#x2019;s observation, grown &#x201c;intensely and increasingly popular,&#x201d; and grief at his passing was judged stronger than the mourning surrounding Queen Victoria&#x2019;s death nine years earlier.15 The first people in the queue to pass King Edward&#x2019;s bier, &#x201c;guarded by household cavalry, soldiers of the line and men from Indian and Colonial contingents, all in the characteristic pose of mourning, that is with bowed heads with their hands crossed over rifle butts and the hilts of their swords,&#x201d; had been &#x201c;three women of the seamstress class: very poorly dressed and very reverent.&#x201d;16 When the Liberal prime minister, Herbert Asquith, was caught leaning against a pillar during the lying in state, courtiers judged &#x201c;his attitude and general demeanour rather offensive&#x201d; and concluded that he must have been tipsy to behave so atrociously or, as one of them put it with leaden subtext, &#x201c;I fear he had dined well.&#x201d;17<br> <br>There were no comparable faux pas at the funeral procession three days later. Many of the mourners had camped out overnight to vouchsafe their place in the crowds, which in places stood one hundred yards deep, to watch Edward VII&#x2019;s body being conducted from Westminster Hall to Windsor. As the catafalque passed Hyde Park, where nearly three hundred thousand had congregated, cigarettes were stubbed out and a forest of caps rose into the air. After the body, the first being to receive these gestures of deference was Caesar, Edward VII&#x2019;s white terrier, who with the Queen Mother&#x2019;s permission trotted by his dead master&#x2019;s side.18 Caesar was followed by nine monarchs on horseback, leading perhaps the largest gathering of royalty in history, with one of the emperors joking that this was the first time in his life he had yielded precedence to a canine.19 Monarchy, the cause in which Edward VII had been such a devout believer, had come to inter &#x201c;the uncle of Europe.&#x201d; His son and heir, now George V, rode with two of the late King&#x2019;s brothers-in-law, Denmark&#x2019;s Frederick VIII and Greece&#x2019;s George I, with one of his sons-in-law, King Haakon VII of Norway, and with two of his nephews&#x2014;one by birth, the other by marriage, both heroically mustached&#x2014;the German Kaiser Wilhelm II and King Alfonso XIII of Spain. They and their glinting medals were joined by the young Portuguese and Belgian sovereigns, Manuel II and Albert I, both on their respective thrones for less than two years. If Prime Minister Asquith&#x2019;s slouching had been noted at the lying in state, so too were other things that mattered deeply to the Edwardian upper classes&#x2014;it was observed by one courtier that the rotund Tsar Ferdinand of Bulgaria had the worst seat on a horse of any royal present; the phrase &#x201c;like a sack&#x201d; was tossed around with uncharitable accuracy.20<br> <br>Affection rippled through the crowd as the fantastic spectacle of the Golden State Coach trundled into view, carrying four women transformed into black pillars by clouds of mourning lace and veil. Edward VII&#x2019;s sixty-five-year-old widow, Alexandra of Denmark, one of the most consistently popular members of the British Royal Family since her arrival in 1863, had borne five children and buried two, but she retained the slender beauty of a person twenty or thirty years her junior. The Prime Minister&#x2019;s daughter-in-law, who watched as Alexandra went by and saw her later at the interment, wrote in her diary that evening, &#x201c;She has the finest carriage and walks better than anyone of our time and not only has she grace, charm and real beauty but all the atmosphere of a fascinating female queen for whom men and women die.&#x201d;21 Joined in the coach by her younger sister the Dowager Empress of Russia, her daughter Queen Maud of Norway, and her daughter-in-law the new Queen Consort, Alexandra was so moved by the sight of the crowds that at Hyde Park she broke with protocol by lifting her veil to bow her head to them, at which point hundreds of people began shouting variations of &#x201c;God bless you!&#x201d;22 Most unusually in a country that still prided itself on its proverbial stiff upper lip when in public, the Queen Mother&#x2019;s gesture produced sobbing from dozens, if not hundreds, of people.23 Behind her carriage came coaches attended by scarlet-liveried footmen and transporting the men who were one day expected to inherit the thrones of Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, Greece, Romania, Serbia, and Montenegro. They were followed by representatives from the reigning houses of Russia, China, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Persia, and Siam. With this dynastic confraternity sat members of the deposed royal houses of France and Brazil, as proudly and conspicuously as if their families still reigned from the Tuileries and S�o Crist�v�o&#x2014;as though nothing had ever really changed and the republics that had toppled them were an aberration, a nightmarish blip from which the world might soon recover. No�lle&#x2019;s husband marched with the dukes, marquesses, and earls of Edward&#x2019;s nobilities, custodians of the hereditary compact that stretched back to before the three British kingdoms and one principality had been ruled by a single house.II Far behind these princes and potentates, America&#x2019;s President Theodore Roosevelt rode with delegates sent by other republics, in a horse-drawn carriage without gilding and manned by footmen in a duller color of livery. The French republic&#x2019;s Foreign Minister was incandescent at the slight; Roosevelt, at least publicly, insisted that h...</p><h2>Art of the Northern Renaissance: Courts, Commerce and Devotion</h2><p>In this lucid account, Stephanie Porras charts the fascinating story of art in northern Europe during the Renaissance period (ca. 1400&#x2013;1570). She explains how artists and patrons from the regions north of the Alps &#x2013; the Low Countries, France, England, Germany &#x2013; responded to an era of rapid political, social, economic, and religious change, while redefining the status of art. <br><br>Porras discusses not only paintings by artists from Jan van Eyck to Pieter Bruegel the Elder, but also sculpture, architecture, prints, metalwork, embroidery, tapestry, and armor. Each chapter presents works from a roughly 20-year period and also focuses on a broad thematic issue, such as the flourishing of the print industry or the mobility of Northern artists and artworks. The author traces the influence of aristocratic courts as centers of artistic production and the rise of an urban merchant class, leading to the creation of new consumers and new art products.<br><br>This book offers a richly illustrated narrative that allows readers to understand the progression, variety, and key conceptual developments of Northern Renaissance art.</p><p>Stephanie Porras is Assistant Professor of Art History at Tulane University.

Larry Hurtado, widely respected for his previous contributions to the study of the New Testament and Christian origins, offers the best view to date of how the first Christians saw and reverenced Jesus as divine. In assembling this compelling picture, Hurtado draws on a wide body of ancient sources, from Scripture and the writings of such figures as Ignatius of Antioch and Justin to apocryphal texts such as the <i>Gospel of Thomas</i> and the <i>Gospel of Truth.</i><br><br> Hurtado considers such themes as early beliefs about Jesus&#x2019; divine status and significance, but he also explores telling devotional practices of the time, including prayer and worship, the use of Jesus&#x2019; name in exorcism, baptism and healing, ritual invocation of Jesus as &#x201c;Lord,&#x201d; martyrdom, and lesser-known phenomena such as prayer postures and the curious scribal practice known today as the <i>nomina sacra.</i><br><br> The revealing portrait that emerges from Hurtado&#x2019;s comprehensive study yields definitive answers to questions like these: How important was this formative period to later Christian tradition? When did the divinization of Jesus first occur? Was early Christianity influenced by neighboring religions? How did the idea of Jesus&#x2019; divinity change old views of God? And why did the powerful dynamics of early beliefs and practices encourage people to make the costly move of becoming a Christian? <br><br> Boasting an unprecedented breadth and depth of coverage &#x2014; the book speaks authoritatively on everything from early Christian history to themes in biblical studies to New Testament Christology &#x2014; Hurtado&#x2019;s <i>Lord Jesus Christ</i> is at once significant enough that a wide range of scholars will want to read it and accessible enough that general readers interested at all in Christian origins will also profit greatly from it.<br><br></p><p>Larry W. Hurtado is professor emeritus of New Testament language, literature, and theology at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.Times Literary Supplement The scope of Hurtado&#39;s reading and his grasp of sources leave us in his debt... He has enabled his readers to comprehend the contours of early Christian beliefs. Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society This volume provides a treatment of its topic that dissenting positions will have to refute if they are to maintain any credibility. First Things Hurtado approaches the early church with an integrity and thoroughness that should be a model for historians and theologians working in this area... His writing is uncomplicated and illuminating, and his sensibilities are evangelical in the best sense of the term. Theology Today An impressive volume... Can be warmly welcomed for the contribution it makes to our understanding of how Christianity&#39;s distinctive appreciation of Christ emerged. Biblica This book provides a painstaking and monumental study of the place of Jesus in the religious life, beliefs and worship of Christians from the beginning of the Christian movement down to the late second century. An outstanding investigation of the origin and development of the earliest Christian devotion to Jesus, Lord Jesus Christ should finally replace Wilhelm Bousset&#39;s Kyrios Christos as the standard work on the subject... All in all, Lord Jesus Christ is to be welcomed as a truly landmark study in the area of early Christian devotion to Jesus. Catholic Biblical Quarterly The present volume is a veritable tour de force, as Hurtado wends his way through the NT, the writings of the apostolic and apologetic Fathers of the Church, and second-century Christian apocrypha... Lord Jesus Christ is a book that deserves to appear on the reading list for comprehensive examinations in theology, not to mention that it also deserves to appear on the library shelves of those who consider themselves veterans in NT study. Presbyterian History Essential reading for everyone serious about understanding the Christian view of the incarnation. David E. Aune A fantastic work! Larry Hurtado has written what may well prove to be one of the more important books on Jesus in this generation. By shifting the focus of discussion away from the historical Jesus and toward the function of Jesus in the religion of early Christians, Hurtado touches on crucial issues that have been largely neglected since Bousset&#39;s Kyrios Christos (1913). In thoroughly probing the role of Jesus in the faith and life of the early Christians, from the beginnings of the church to well into the second century, Hurtado asks the right questions and provides many of the right answers. This book will be extremely useful for those attempting to understand Christianity in the context of the history of religion. Martin Hengel This is a great and necessary book. We have been waiting for it for years, and now it will strongly influence New Testament scholarship, especially in the fields of christology and early Christian history. By remaining in constant critical discussion with scholars holding differing opinions, Larry Hurtado also shows the progress of research during the last decades. Everybody working in this domain has to take account of his Lord Jesus Christ. Many thanks to Hurtado for his valuable gift! Alan F. Segal Larry Hurtado locates the presence of the Christ in early Christianity with a scholarly exactness never before achieved. The story he tells is important for all Christians and for all historians of Christianity. This will be one of the most important books on early Christianity in the twenty-first century. John S. Kloppenborg Among his many significant achievements, Larry Hurtado reconceives &#34;Christology&#34; as &#34;Christ devotion,&#34; which embraces not only beliefs about Jesus but also practices and aspects of material and visual culture. In this ambitious and erudite volume Hurtado analyzes not just the standard repertoire of canonical sources -- Paul&#39;s letters, the canonical Gospels, Hebrews, the pastoral letters -- but also the sayings source Q, the Gospels of Peter and Thomas, Infancy Thomas, the Protoevangelium of James, and various gospel fragments, achieving a scope and depth rarely seen in monographs on the topic since the classic of Wilhelm Bousset. Attentive to detail and nuance, broad in its learning, and careful in its arguments, Lord Jesus Christ is a landmark in scholarship on Christian origins. Even though one might disagree with Hurtado in certain respects, he is always worth reading -- and reading carefully. Graham Stanton Larry Hurtado&#39;s new book is a stunning achievement. It explores with admirable rigor and clarity a central issue all too often ducked or evaded: How, when, and why did devotion to Jesus as a divine figure emerge within earliest Christianity? Hurtado has to negotiate many minefields as he takes his readers across a vast terrain. He is a wise guide whose judgment can be trusted, for his scholarship is of the highest order. This book is already on my shortlist of &#34;books of the decade.&#34; Max Tuner This monumental, authoritative, readily accessible study clearly demonstrates that worship of Jesus as one with God emerged and flourished in the earliest church and in the context of dedicated Jewish-Christian monotheism (not in a Gentile Christianity that had broken with it, as the consensus since Bousset has maintained). Not just a landmark contribution, this work changes the whole landscape of the discussion.</p><h2>Hobos, Hustlers, and Backsliders: Homeless in San Francisco</h2><p><b><p>Winner of the 2011 Robert Park Award for the Best Book in Community and Urban Sociology, American Sociological Association, 2011</p><p>Co-winner of the 2011 Mary Douglas Prize for Best Book in the Sociology of Culture, American Sociological Association, 2011</p></b>&nbsp;When homelessness reemerged in American cities during the 1980s at levels not seen since the Great Depression, it initially provoked shock and outrage. Within a few years, however, what had been perceived as a national crisis came to be seen as a nuisance, with early sympathies for the plight of the homeless giving way to compassion fatigue and then condemnation. Debates around the problem of homelessness&#x2014;often set in terms of sin, sickness, and the failure of the social system&#x2014;have come to profoundly shape how homeless people survive and make sense of their plights. In <i>Hobos, Hustlers, and Backsliders</i>, Teresa Gowan vividly depicts the lives of homeless men in San Francisco and analyzes the influence of the homelessness industry on the streets, in the shelters, and on public policy.&nbsp;Gowan shows some of the diverse ways that men on the street in San Francisco struggle for survival, autonomy, and self-respect. Living for weeks at a time among homeless men&#x2014;working side-by-side with them as they collected cans, bottles, and scrap metal; helping them set up camp; watching and listening as they panhandled and hawked newspapers; and accompanying them into soup kitchens, jails, welfare offices, and shelters&#x2014;Gowan immersed herself in their routines, their personal stories, and their perspectives on life on the streets. She observes a wide range of survival techniques, from the illicit to the industrious, from drug dealing to dumpster diving. She also discovered that prevailing discussions about homelessness and its causes&#x2014;homelessness as pathology, homelessness as moral failure, and homelessness as systemic failure&#x2014;powerfully affect how homeless people see themselves and their ability to change their situation.&nbsp;Drawing on five years of fieldwork, this powerful ethnography of men living on the streets of the most liberal city in America, <i>Hobos, Hustlers, and Backsliders</i>, makes clear that the way we talk about issues of extreme poverty has real consequences for how we address this problem&#x2014;and for the homeless themselves.</p><p><p>Teresa Gowan is assistant professor of sociology at the University of Minnesota.</p><p>"<i>Hobos, Hustlers, and Backsliders</i> is spectacular ethnography, fearlessly conducted by a 'small, white English woman' among homeless men in San Francisco's roughest neighborhoods. The big surprise is not the hostility of the police or the shortage of services, but the determination of so many of these men to build a career out of recycling trash. Gowan's respect for her subjects and her willingness to pitch in with the dirtiest of work-dumpster diving, for example-make this a gripping read as well as a powerful call to reassess how America treats its most despised and marginal people." &#x2014;Barbara Ehrenreich</p><br><br><p>"This elegantly written and clearly analyzed long-term ethnography of homelessness takes off where <i>Righteous Dopefiend </i>ends. Teresa Gowan offers the reader a comprehensive analysis of the full range of survival strategies found on the streets of San Francisco at the turn of the 21st century: from dumpster divers, recyclers, panhandlers, and triumphantly oppositional petty thieves who pursue heroin and/or crack by all means necessary, to self-blaming addicts bemoaning their failure to adhere to self-help sobriety regimens." &#x2014;Philippe Bourgois, author of I<i>n Search of Respect </i>and <i>Righteous Dopefiend</i></p></p><h2>An Irish Country Girl (Irish Country, Book 4)</h2><p><p>Readers of Patrick Taylor's books know Mrs. Kinky Kincaid as the unflappable housekeeper who looks after two frequently frazzled town doctors in the colourful Irish village of Ballybucklebo.

She beamed over them. She liked children, would have loved to have had some of her own, but that hadn&#x2019;t been meant to be. She smiled sadly to herself.</p><p>She probably could have found another fellah here in Ulster, but och, he&#x2019;d not have been the Paudeen Kincaid she lost so long ago. She saw herself in the hall mirror and thought she&#x2019;d not been a bad-looking lass when she&#x2019;d been with Paudeen. Her silver hair, which she wore in a chignon now, was chestnut then and had flowed in soft waves to her shoulders. It was the worry about him one Saint Stephen&#x2019;s Day that had started the turning of it.</p><p>She&#x2019;d been a slim girl then. Now, she knew she could afford to lose a couple of stone, although doing so wouldn&#x2019;t get rid of her three chins. But it was hard not to sample her own cooking, and she did love to cook. She always had, ever since Ma had showed her how all those years ago.</p><p>She shook her head, and sure if the years had passed, hadn&#x2019;t they been good ones ever since she&#x2019;d come here, first as house keeper to old Doctor Flanagan and later on, in 1946, to Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly when he took over the practice? And hadn&#x2019;t looking after those two bachelor men been a satisfying job, and almost the same as rearing chisellers?</p><p>Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly, learned man that he was, would not get out of the house without egg stains on his tie if she wasn&#x2019;t there to sponge them off or make him change it. He often called his Labrador, Arthur Guinness, a great lummox. Sometimes, she thought with affection, the pot does call the kettle black.</p><p>&#x201c;Pleath, Mithis Kincaid?&#x201d; A child&#x2019;s voice interrupted her thoughts.</p><p>She saw Billy Cadogan, a boy who suffered from asthma. He&#x2019;d been a patient of the practice since Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly and Miss Hagerty, the midwife, had delivered him ten years ago. &#x201c;Yes, Billy?&#x201d; He looked smart in what must be his brand-new cap and bright red mittens.</p><p>He held up his mug. &#x201c;Pleath, Mithis Kincaid, can I have a toty wee taste more? Ith cold thinging carolth round the houtheth today, tho it ith.&#x201d;</p><p>So, she thought, she should have known that Billy was the one lisping when they sang &#x201c;We Wish You a Merry Christmas.&#x201d;</p><p>Before she could answer, Colin Brown chipped in, &#x201c;Billy&#x2019;s right; it would found er you.&#x201d; Even today he was wearing short pants. His bare knees stuck out from under his overcoat, and his left sock was crumpled around his ankle. Colin was the lad who had single-handedly, as the innkeeper at the recent Nativity play, caused the mother superior to faint. Colin spoke again. &#x201c;My Da says it&#x2019;s as cold as a witch&#x2019;s tit today, so he does.&#x201d;</p><p>Kinky frowned, then seeing the seriousness on the boy&#x2019;s face, realized that he was merely repeating what he had heard his notoriously foul-mouthed father say. &#x201c;And what would you know of witches, Colin Brown?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Oooh,&#x201c; said Colin, &#x201c;witches is oul&#x2019; wizenedy women with wrinkles and warts on their green faces. They have black cats, they wear pointy hats and black dresses, ride around on broomsticks on Halloween night... they cast spells, and...&#x201d;&#x2014;he frowned&#x2014;&#x201d;and...&#x201d; Then a smile split his face and his words came out in a rush. &#x201c;And they get together in ovens.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Colin means &#x2018;covens.&#x2019; &#x201c; That was Hazel Arbuthnot. She was Aggie Arbuthnot&#x2019;s twelve-year-old daughter. She had lustrous black hair, just like her mother. For a moment, Kinky wondered if Hazel had also inherited the family trait of six toes. No doubt Cissie Sloan, Aggie&#x2019;s cousin and the most talkative woman in the village, would know.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, Hazel, covens.&#x201d; Kinky heard the other children laughing at Colin&#x2019;s discomfiture. &#x201c;And there&#x2019;s no need to laugh at Colin. He nearly got it right.&#x201d;</p><p>The giggling subsided.</p><p>&#x201c;And some witches do cast evil spells and sour the milk, or make the crops fail or animals die&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oooh.&#x201d; Several voices were raised, and Kinky heard sharp in-drawings of breath.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2014;but some are good witches.&#x201d; She paused to let that sink in.</p><p>&#x201c;Good witches?&#x201d; Eddie Jingles asked. He&#x2019;d had pneumonia two weeks before Christmas. He was better now, but his mother, Jeannie, had very sensibly wrapped him up in boots, thick trousers, a heavy anorak, a green scarf, and a blue-and-white-striped wool toque. &#x201c;I never knew there was good witches. Are you having us on, Mrs. Kincaid?&#x201d;</p><p>Kinky scowled at him, then let a smile play at the corners of her mouth. &#x201c;Why would you think I was making it up, Eddie Jingles?&#x201d;</p><p>Eddie blushed and lowered his head. &#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now,&#x201c; she said, &#x201c;how many of you believe there are good witches? Hold up your hands.&#x201d;</p><p>Jeannie Kennedy&#x2019;s hand was the first to go up, then Micky Corry&#x2019;s. Those two had been Mary and Joseph in the Christmas pageant earlier that week. The last hand raised was Colin Brown&#x2019;s, but Kinky had expected that. Colin had a mind of his own.</p><p>&#x201c;Good. So we&#x2019;re all in agreement then?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Mrs. Kincaid,&#x201c; a chorus of voices replied.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad to hear it.&#x201d; She lowered her voice and let her gaze wander over the group, looking this one, then that one, right in the eye. &#x201c;Because my own mother was a good witch, so. My very own mother, and she got it from her mother, my granny.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Does that make you a witch too, Mrs. Kincaid... since your mammy was one?&#x201d; Colin had his head cocked to one side, his eyes narrowed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve no warts on your nose, like.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be impudent, Colin Brown.&#x201d; She put her face closer to his, flared her nostrils, and widened her eyes. &#x201c;Or I&#x2019;ll turn you into a tooooadstool.&#x201d;</p><p>The communal &#x201c;oooh&#x201d; was much louder.</p><p>Seeing the look on Colin&#x2019;s face, Kinky softened. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m only pulling your leg, son, so, for I&#x2019;m not a witch at all. I couldn&#x2019;t turn you into anything.&#x201d; Even if I did get the sight to see the future from my mother, Kinky thought, but that&#x2019;s none of their business. &#x201c;And if I was... if... I&#x2019;d be a good witch and lift spells or smell out bad witches or cure people with herbs or find water wells&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;With a hazel twig?&#x201d; Billy Cadogan interrupted.</p><p>&#x201c;Or a Hazel Arbuthnot,&#x201c; Colin said, then sniggered and stuck his tongue out at Hazel.</p><p>&#x201c;Less of that, Colin, or I&#x2019;ll not tell you any more,&#x201c; Kinky said.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201c; Colin said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll houl&#x2019; my wheest. Honest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You do that, so,&#x201c; said Kinky. She let a silence hang, and hang, until Hazel said, &#x201c;Pay him no heed, Mrs. Kincaid. He was just acting the lig. I don&#x2019;t mind. Go on, please tell us more.&#x201d;</p><p>Several other children added, &#x201c;Please... please.&#x201d;</p><p>Kinky smiled. The sight wasn&#x2019;t the only thing she&#x2019;d got from her family, and that was a story in itself. Her Da, God rest him, had been a famous seanachie, a storyteller, and Kinky Kincaid, when given an audience, liked nothing better than to spin a good yarn.</p><p>&#x201c;So, it&#x2019;s a story you want?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please.&#x201d; She saw the expec...</p></p><h2>Tell Me What You Want: The Science of Sexual Desire and How It Can Help You Improve Your Sex Life</h2><p><b>A leading expert on human sexuality and author of the blog Sex and Psychology offers an unprecedented look at sexual fantasy based on the most comprehensive, scientific survey ever undertaken. <b><br></b><br></b>What do Americans really want when it comes to sex? And is it possible for us to get what we want? Justin J. Lehmiller, one of the country's leading experts on human sexuality and author of the popular blog <i>Sex and Psychology</i>, has made it his career's ambition to answer these questions. He recently concluded the largest and most comprehensive scientific survey of Americans' sexual fantasies ever undertaken, a monumental two-year study involving more than 4,000 Americans from all walks of life, answering questions of unusual scope. <br><br>Based on this study, <i>Tell Me What You Want</i> offers an unprecedented look into our fantasy worlds and what they reveal about us. It helps readers to better understand their own sexual desires and how to attain them within their relationships, but also to appreciate why the desires of their partners may be so incredibly different. <br><br>If we only better understood the incredible diversity of human sexual desire and why this diversity exists in the first place, we would experience less distress, anxiety, and shame about our own sexual fantasies and better understand why our partners often have sexual proclivities that are so different from our own. Ultimately, this book will help readers to enhance their sex lives and to maintain more satisfying relationships and marriages in the future by breaking down barriers to discussing sexual fantasies and allowing them to become a part of readers' sexual realities. <b><br></b></p><p>Dr. Justin J.

Buckley Jr., and the Debate over Race in America</h2><p><p><b>How the clash between the civil rights firebrand and the father of modern conservatism continues to illuminate America's racial divide</b></p><p>On February 18, 1965, an overflowing crowd packed the Cambridge Union in Cambridge, England, to witness a historic televised debate between James Baldwin, the leading literary voice of the civil rights movement, and William F. Buckley Jr., a fierce critic of the movement and America's most influential conservative intellectual. The topic was "the American dream is at the expense of the American Negro," and no one who has seen the debate can soon forget it. Nicholas Buccola's <i>The Fire Is upon Us</i> is the first book to tell the full story of the event, the radically different paths that led Baldwin and Buckley to it, the controversies that followed, and how the debate and the decades-long clash between the men continues to illuminate America's racial divide today.</p><p>Born in New York City only fifteen months apart, the Harlem-raised Baldwin and the privileged Buckley could not have been more different, but they both rose to the height of American intellectual life during the civil rights movement. By the time they met in Cambridge, Buckley was determined to sound the alarm about a man he considered an "eloquent menace." For his part, Baldwin viewed Buckley as a deluded reactionary whose popularity revealed the sickness of the American soul. The stage was set for an epic confrontation that pitted Baldwin's call for a moral revolution in race relations against Buckley's unabashed elitism and implicit commitment to white supremacy.</p><p>A remarkable story of race and the American dream, <i>The Fire Is upon Us </i>reveals the deep roots and lasting legacy of a conflict that continues to haunt our politics.</p></p><p>This book uses the lens of a famous debate between novelist James Baldwin and conservative political writer William F. Buckley at Cambridge to tell the story of the radical divide in American politics regarding race and the American Dream.<b>Nicholas Buccola</b> is the author of <i>The Political Thought of Frederick Douglass</i> and the editor of <i>The Essential Douglass</i> and <i>Abraham Lincoln and Liberal Democracy</i>.

By investigating previously unknown sources, the book uncovers the real story of how baseball evolved from a gentleman's amateur sport of "well-bred play followed by well-laden banquet tables" into a professional sport where big leagues operate under their own laws. Offering countless anecdotes and a wealth of new information, the authors explode many cherished myths, including the one which claims that Abner Doubleday "invented" baseball in 1839. They describe the influence of baseball on American business, manners, morals, social institutions, and even show business, as well as depicting the types of men who became the first professional ball players, club owners, and managers, including Spalding, McGraw, Comiskey, and Connie Mack.<br><br>Note: On August 2, 2010, Oxford University Press made public that it would credit Dorothy Seymour Mills as co-author of the three baseball histories previously "authored" solely by her late husband, Harold Seymour.

S. Trow&#39;s brilliant exposition on the state of American culture and twentieth-century life. Published to widespread acclaim, Within the Context of No Context became an immediate classic and is, to this day, a favorite work of writers and critics alike. Both a chilling commentary on the times in which it was written and an eerie premonition of the future, Trow&#39;s work locates and traces, describes and analyzes the components of change in contemporary America -- a culture increasingly determined by the shallow worlds of consumer products, daytime television, and celebrity heroes. &#34;This elegant little book is essential reading for anyone interested in the demise, the terminal silliness, of our culture.&#34; -- John Irving, The New York Times Book Review; &#34;In this elegant, poignant essay, written with the grace of a master stylist, George Trow articulates the accelerated impermanence of American culture with a precision that is both flaunting and devastating.&#34; -- Rudy Wurlitrer; &#34;Within the Context of No Context is a masterpiece of the century that belongs on a shelf next to Theodore Adorno&#39;s Minima Moralia and Guy Debord&#39;s The Society of the Spectacle.&#34; -- Michael Tolkin; &#34;Within the Context of No Context may appear to be a book of the mind, for it is suffused with such a keen intelligence, but it is actually a book of the heart -- passionate, brave, and stirring.&#34; -- Sue Halpern.</p><p>Long-time <i>New Yorker</i> writer George W. S. Trow first published the long title essay of this book in 1981, and it now appears with a companion piece, "Collapsing Dominant." Taken together, the two essays are a trenchant and often scathing examination of American culture. As Trow surveys the landscape, he observes that television has created a land of "no context," which it then gleefully chronicles. The many examples he cites of things he has witnessed in the mass media are alarming not for what he has seen--for we have all seen this stuff--but for the intense, and at times lacerating, insight with which he views the passing parade of frivolity. <i>Within the Context of No Context</i> is a slim book that does much to explain modern American society, and the thoughts in its pages will resonate for a long time.First appearing in The New Yorker in 1978 (Trow wrote the "Talk of the Town" pieces) and published by Little, Brown in 1981, this volume dissects 20th-century American culture and how it had spiraled downward in ever-tightening circles into decay.

Conspiracies, rebellions, and revolutions jostle side by side with court intrigues, political infighting and the rise of parties. In 1603 Britain was an isolated archipelago; by 1714 it had emerged among the intellectual, commercial, and military centers of the world. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Kishlansky&#x2019;s century saw one king executed, another exiled, the House of Lords abolished, and the Church of England reconstructed along Presbyterian lines . . . A masterly narrative, shot through with the shrewdness that comes from profound scholarship.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jonathan Clark, <i>Spectator</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;A historian with a real love for the period, a real understanding of many different aspects of it, and an exhilarating style.&#x201d;&#x2014;Ronald Hutton, <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;This sweeping, dramatic chronicle of a century of Stuart rule will rivet even the general reader with no particular interest in British history.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p><b>Mark Kishlansky</b>&nbsp;was the Frank Baird Jr Professor of History at Harvard University and one of the world's leading scholars on Stuart England. He is the author of <i>A Monarchy Transformed</i>, the 17th-century volume in the Penguin History of England series. He is also the coauthor of <i>Societies and Culture in World History</i> and <i>Civilization in the West</i>. He died in 2015.A beautifully written but narrowly focused narrative of high politics in 17th-century Britain. Kishlansky (English and European History/Harvard) recognizes that history is a story and that a good historian is a storyteller. His strongly delineated point of view contributes to the flow of the narrative, and his enthusiasm for the subject sustains the reader through thickets of detail about high politics and war. Viewing 17th-century Britain through the eyes of those at the top, Kishlansky always comes down on the side of political stability. He successfully avoids uncritical power worship with judicious criticism of both the Stuart monarchs and of Cromwell. However, as a volume in the new Penguin History of Britain (see also Peter Clarke, Hope and Glory: Britain 19001990, p. 186), A Monarchy Transformed is intended to provide a definitive introductory guide for the student and general reader. Although every historian must leave things out of the story, too many important things are neglected in this one. Kishlansky mentions in passing such important matters as Britain's overseas empire, the slave trade, art and literature, science and mathematics, but doesn't weave such materials into his narrative. John Donne is identified merely as a recipient of royal patronage, and John Milton dismissed as an ``ideologue.'' The momentous religious changes of the period are discussed mainly when they influence politics or threaten social stability. What is most disappointing, though, is the treatment of women. Queen Mary is mentioned and Queen Anne gets a chapter, but beyond that women appear at the margins of history, as irrational teenage royal brides or midwives accused of kidnapping children for satanic rituals. Women should not be marginalized in any volume that aspires to the status of a general survey. Although successful as a forceful narrative of politics at the center, this volume is a disappointing general introduction to 17th-century British history. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The snoozing fellow was the color of golden sand&#x2014;indeed, he seemed to be made of the stuff. And his unruly hair twirled and twisted as he slept. He rested in the dune-covered center of a tiny star-shaped island that was nearly impossible for humans to find, for it was not originally from the Earth. The island was not connected to anything; no landmass beneath the ocean anchored it in place. As such, it was the only island on our planet that truly floated atop the water. Because of this, it drifted. In June it might be in the Pacific Ocean, and by July it might be off the coast of Madagascar, its whereabouts known only to the Moon and the stars.<br> <br>Which was fitting, for this island had once been a star.

But Sanderson Mansnoozie&#x2019;s long sleep had been most productive. He was now more powerful than he had ever been: He had power over the world of dreams.

Tell My Horse (1938), part ethnography, part travel book, vividly recounts the survival of African religion in Jamaican obeah and Haitian voodoo in the 1930s. Keenly alert to political and intellectual currents, Hurston went beyond superficial exoticism to explore the role of these religious systems in their societies. The text is illustrated by 26 photographs, many of them taken by Huston. Her extensive transcriptions of Creole songs here accompanied by new translation. A special feature of this volume is Hurston's controversial 1942 autobiography, Dust Tracks on a Road. Withconsultation by Henry Louis Gates, Jr., it is presented here for the first time as she intended, restoring passages omitted by the original publisher because of political controversy, sexual candor, or fear of libel. Included in an appendix are four additional chapters, one never before published, that represent earlier stages of Hurston's conception of the book. Twenty-two essays, from "The Eatonville Anthology" (1926) to "Court Order Can't Make Races Mix" (1955), demonstrate the range of Hurston's concerns as they cover subjects from religion, music, and Harlem slang to Jim Crow and American democracy. The chronology of Hurston's life prepared for this edition sheds fresh light on many aspects of her career. In addition, this volume contains detailed notes and a brief essay on the texts.<b>Zora Neale Hurston</b> (1891-1960) was a&nbsp;novelist, short story writer,&nbsp;folklorist, and&nbsp;anthropologist&nbsp;and a major figure in the Harlem Renaissance best known for her 1937 novel <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i>.<br><br><b>Cheryl A.

The headline in the morning paper was a reminder of why he was there, parked in front of the mirrored-glass, fourteen-story Marine Drilling International building.<br><br>It was still hot as Hades today, the first of September, the sun and humidity baking him in his navy blue suit and white shirt as he strode toward the wide concrete steps leading up to the front doors. The clothes were the worst part of a protection detail&#x2014;wearing a jacket and tie instead of the jeans and T-shirts he lived in most of the time. But the pay was top-notch and he'd been getting more and more restless sitting behind a desk at Atlas Security, handling the day-to-day management of the company while the owner, his best friend, Trace Rawlins, and Trace's wife, Maggie, were off on an extended honeymoon in Australia.<br><br>Jake was damn glad they were finally home.<br><br>Pushing through the heavy glass doors, he entered the lobby, icy-cold in comparison to the wet heat outside. He headed for the bank of elevators and stepped inside one, pushed the button for the twelfth floor, then waited through the ride to the executive level.<br><br>The time hands on his heavy steel wristwatch said he was a few minutes early for his ten o'clock appointment with Ian Dumont, the founder of Marine Drilling, CEO and chairman of the board. The family-owned business, originally Dumont Drilling, had been in oil production since the fifties, when Ian had made his first big strike along the Gulf Coast.<br><br>Today, they were mostly in offshore oil and gas production, thus the name change to Marine Drilling International. The Dumont family was well-known in Houston society, with big money and everything that went with it.<br><br>Walking out of the elevator, he made his way across shiny black granite floor to the reception desk, where his shoes sank into thick gray carpet. The waiting area was all black leather sofas and chairs, the desk itself smooth dark walnut and chrome. Nothing but the best for the Dumonts.<br><br>A good-looking woman in her late twenties with wavy, shoulder-length, mink-brown hair was busily searching the drawers and cabinets behind the desk. The way she bent over in her tailored pencil skirt provided him with a perfect view of a very shapely ass.<br><br>He almost smiled.<br><br>Even the help was first-class.<br><br>She jerked upright at his approach, noticing him for the first time, and her face colored. It was a pretty face with amazing golden-brown eyes that looked him up and down, which took a while, Jake being six-five, two hundred thrty-five pounds.<br><br>"May I help you?" she asked.<br><br>He gave her a smile. "I'm Jake Cantrell. I've got an appointment at ten with Ian Dumont."<br><br>She frowned, looked down at the computer screen on the desk, but apparently didn't see his name. "He didn't mention it. He's getting ready for another meeting. You might have to wait awhile."<br><br>"Not a problem. In the meantime, I could sure use a cup of coffee."<br><br>Amusement tipped her mouth up, making a tiny dimple appear next to those plump, rose-colored lips. He could see the curves beneath her tailored suit, suggesting her breasts were just the right size, and her waist was small.<br><br>Jake's groin tightened. Which surprised him, since he needed the coffee to recover from the night he'd spent with Deanna Leblanc, an old flame who was in Houston to film a TV commercial.<br><br>The receptionist cast him a look. "I'll see what I can do." But she didn't make a move, just turned to the woman hurrying toward her across the waiting room.<br><br>"Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late, Ms. Dumont," the newcomer said.<br><br><em>Son of a bitch. A Dumont,</em> Jake thought. Asking her to fetch him a cup of coffee was probably not the best idea he'd ever had.<br><br>"Is Paulo all right?" the Dumont woman asked.<br><br>"My son wasn't driving, thank God." The real receptionist, attractive and in her mid-forties, had straight black hair pulled back in a bun and smooth, olive skin. "Paulo has a concussion and a couple of fractured ribs, but it looks like he's going to be okay. Thank you for covering while I was gone."<br><br>"Your boy was in a car accident, Marie. It wasn't a problem. I'm just glad he's going to be all right." The Dumont woman tipped her head toward Jake, her soft mahogany curls sliding around her shoulders, making the muscles across his abdomen clench.<br><br>"Mr. Cantrell is here to see Ian," she said. "I have to get to the meeting. Could you fetch him a cup of coffee while he waits?"<br><br>Jake felt the slight rebuke in the glance she cast his way. Clearly, she wasn't used to fetching a man much of anything.<br><br>"Of course," Marie said. Ms. Dumont walked away, heading for the tall walnut door leading into Ian Dumont's imperial domain. Her strides were long and purposeful, Jake noticed, as if she had someplace important to go. He liked a woman who didn't dawdle. And his earlier assessment was right&#x2014;she had a great ass and a pair of legs that wouldn't quit. She was only about five-six, but her expensive spike heels pushed her somewhere close to six feet.<br><br>He watched her disappear behind the door, wondering what role she played in the Dumont empire, then turned his attention to the receptionist.<br><br>Marie was smiling. "Mr. Cantrell?"<br><br>"That's right."<br><br>"Mr. Dumont mentioned yesterday that you would be coming in this morning. I believe he wants to see you as soon as you arrive." She indicated the office door. "I'll bring coffee for everyone into the meeting."<br><br>"Thank you, Marie."<br><br>The woman blushed as Jake turned and walked away.<br><br>It was his size mostly, he figured, that made women take a second look. He was used to it by now.<br><br>He swung open the walnut door and stepped inside, finding only two people in the room&#x2014;the woman he had subtly insulted and a silver-haired gentleman in his late seventies, slightly stooped but still impressive, undoubtedly Ian Dumont.<br><br>"Mr. Cantrell, I assume," the man said. "Our mutual friend, Trace Rawlins, had nothing but good things to say when he recommended you for this job." Trace knew Ian well. He'd recently helped design the state-of-the-art alarm system for Marine Drilling when the building was renovated. "Please join us."<br><br>The Dumont woman was staring, one of her dark eyebrows slightly elevated in question. He noticed she was wearing a flashy diamond engagement ring. Since he felt a jolt of heat whenever he looked at her, it was probably good she was out of his reach.<br><br>Ian Dumont walked the length of the long conference table to greet him, reaching out to shake his hand&#x2014;a strong, solid handshake that set the tone for the discussion ahead. He'd once had calluses on those hands, Jake figured.<br><br>"Why don't we all sit down?" the CEO suggested.<br><br>They grouped themselves at one end of the table, which was done in the same walnut and chrome as the waiting area. Wide plate-glass windows looked down on the city streets, and modern artwork in bold bright colors lined the inner walls.<br><br>The door swung open and Marie walked in with a silver coffee service. She set the tray down on the table and poured each of them a cup.<br><br>"Thank you, Marie," Ian said as she quietly headed back out the door. He fixed his attention on Jake. "I asked you here today to discuss providing security for one of our people during an upcoming business negotiation."<br><br>"Right. An S. E. Dumont, you said, when we spoke on the phone."<br><br>"That is correct."<br><br>"Wait a minute," the woman interrupted, her gaze sliding toward Jake. "Ian, you aren't thinking&#x2014;"<br><br>"Mr. Cantrell, I'd like you to meet my granddaughter, Sage Elizabeth Dumont."<br><br>The room fell silent. Son of a bitch. <em>She</em> was his assignment?<br><br>"I don't need a bodyguard, Ian."<br><br>The older man turned toward her, a determined glint in eyes that looked strikingly similar to the flashing, gold-ringed brown ones belonging to his granddaughter.<br><br>"This man has experience in Middle Eastern protocol as well as a background in personal security. Isn't that correct, Mr. Cantrell?"<br><br>"This is a business transaction," Sage argued. "I'm not in any sort of danger."<br><br>Both men ignored her. "Over the years, I've done a lot of corporate protection work, both in South America and the Middle East," Jake said. "I worked in Saudi Arabia for three years after I got out of the marines. So yes, I'm familiar with the protocols."<br><br>"I understand you were in Special Forces. You served in Iraq, I believe?"<br><br>"That's right." Ian Dumont had done his homework.<br><br>"Sage is vice president of acquisitions and distribution for Marine Drilling. Currently she is involved in a transaction that may reach the three-hundred-million-dollar mark, a deal being negotiated with Sheik Khalid Al Kahzaz of Saudi Arabia. The sheik and his family are due to arrive in just a few days."<br><br>"I see," Jake said noncommittally. Protecting a corporate executive was one thing. Protecting a young socialite who got her job because she was a member of the Dumont family was something altogether different.<br><br>"With your experience," Ian continued, as Jake took a sip of his coffee, "I'm hoping you will be able to guide my granddaughter through this visit with our Saudi friends, and should any trouble arise, also keep her safe."<br><br>"That's what I get paid for."<br><br>Sage shifted in her chair, irritation clear in her face. "We need to discuss this in private, Ian."<br><br>The old man smiled indulgently. "We can do that, of course, but the result will be the same. You're representing Marine Drilling International. You will be prominently engaged in entertaining the sheik, his daughter and son, and the remainder of his party. The unrest in their part of the world has reached all the way to our city. A man was killed in a Middle Eastern prodemoc-racy demonstration last night."<br><br>"That was an accident," Sage protested. "He was hit by a car."<br><br>"The police are still investigating. They're not completely certain what actually happened. And even if it was an accident, tempers are running hot on all fronts. Your safety is vitally important to me. Mr. Cantrell will make certain you are safe."<br><br>"But&#x2014;"<br><br>"It will only be during the day, for as long as the sheik is here, or when you are somewhere entertaining him and his family. Along with that, there are things you need to know that Mr. Cantrell can teach you."<br><br>Her shoulders tightened. "I understand there are business protocols, things I need to be aware of. I planned to research the subject. I've just been so busy...."<br><br>"You work too hard, my dear. You need someone to help you. Mr. Cantrell can handle that." Her grandfather rose from his chair and turned to Jake when he stood up, too. "When can you start?"<br><br>Part of him wanted to refuse the assignment. Jake didn't want to deal with a bossy, cantankerous female. The other part was looking for something interesting to do after weeks of mostly sitting behind a desk. And keeping a pampered young woman like Sage Dumont out of trouble probably wouldn't be dull.<br><br>"If we have only a short time before they arrive," he found himself saying, "we had better get started today."<br><br>"Splendid!" Ian said.<br><br>Sage's spine went a little straighter. She fixed her gaze on Jake. Even in her high heels she had to look up at him, which he could tell she didn't like.<br><br>"Fine," she said. "I'll see you in my office in half an hour. Does that work for you?"<br><br>"I'll be there."<br><br>And then she was gone.<br><br>As soon as the door swooshed shut behind her, Jake heard Ian chuckle. "I knew she was going to pitch a fit about this&#x2014;actually, I expected far worse. But I want her safe. She means everything to me, Mr. Cantrell."<br><br>"It's just Jake. And you can count on me to take care of her&#x2014;whether she likes it or not."<br><br></p><h2>Yearning for the Wind: Celtic Reflections on Nature and the Soul</h2><p>Emminent Celtic-American writer Tom Cowan&#x2019;s latest book weaves together chapters about the interplay of soul and nature, and describes how this interplay creates mystical pathways between the human and nonhuman worlds. Throughout the ages, shamans and mystics have recognized that all created things share some level of consciousness, and that ordinary and non-ordinary realities interact on some level. This wonderful book explores those interactions and those interconnected pathways. It is a book that conveys the interdependence of our "material" life with the life of nature and with our inner life.<br><br>Each beautifully crafted chapter is a small window into the mysteries of nature and soul, a meditation on Spirit infusing our daily lives. By looking closely at some object or creature in the natural world, Cowan seems to open our eyes inward, to the truths that wait within. The book is both an intimate portrait of one shaman, the author, talking to nature and a masterful teaching on the universal qualities of our lives and the way we live in our world, spiritually and physically. Cowan draws on the teachings of medieval mystics, legends of fairies, Celtic songs, present-day poets and seekers, and Native American stories.</p><p></p><h2>Donkey Gospel: Poems</h2><p><p><b>Winner of the 1997 James Laughlin Award of The Academy of American Poets</b></p><p>In Donkey Gospel, his second collection of poems, Hoagland's generous effervescence and a jujitsu cleverness sparkle through line after line confronting negotiation and compromise, gender and culture, sex and rock music, sons and lovers, truth and beauty, and so forth.

Here, the Chinese are seen as "the new Jews." What could be more natural than for Mona to take this literally&#x2014;even to the point of converting? As Mona attends temple "rap" sessions and falls in love (with a nice Jewish boy who lives in a tepee), Jen introduces us to one of the most charming and sweet-spirited heroines in recent fiction, a girl who can wisecrack with perfect aplomb even when she's organizing the help in her father's pancake house. On every page, Gish Jen sets our received notions spinning with a wit as dry as a latter-day Jane Austen's.</p><p>The heroine of <i>Mona in the Promised Land</i> is a true child of the suburbs. Mona--a self-described "self-made mouth" goes to temple, loves pickles, is boy-crazy, worries about getting into the right college and keeping up with her over-achieving sister, and wishes her parents were less strict. Her equally Jewish Westchester classmates hardly notice what everyone else finds hard to forget: Mona may be Jewish by choice (and voice) and American by nationality, but her surname is Chang and so she is considered less an expert on seders and schmaltz than China. <p> In Gish Jen's hands, '70s suburbia is a place of buoyant hope and change. While Mona's parents worry about what she'll do next--her mother suggesting at one point that she might even want to be black, Mona ripostes that that's not a religion. She does, however admit to knowing "some kids studying to be Bobby Seale. They call each other brother, and eat soul food instead of subs, and wear their hair in the baddest Afros they can manage." The divide between past conservatism and present bohemia is one of the novel's concerns, but its epigraphs hint at the porous nature of cultural identity, of groups taking what they choose from one another. As for Gish Jen, she turns out to be a descendant of Laurence Sterne. <i>Mona</i> has the buttonholing narrator, the rollicking comedy that modulates into genuine sadness, and the incidental but all-important details that might confuse those intent on the author's ethnicity but will delight everyone else.</p>In this ebullient and inventive novel, Gish Jen restores multiculturalism from high concept to a fact of life. At least that's what it becomes for teenaged Mona Chang, who in 1968 moves with her newly prosperous family to Scarshill, New York, where the Chinese have become "the new Jews." What could be more natural than for Mona to take this literally--even to the point of converting?

Ruether ( Mary: The Feminine Face of the Church , Westminster/John Knox Pr., 1977) shows how these patriarchal stories still permeate the culture and social structure of the Western world today. She eloquently critiques these values from an ecological and feminist point of view, exploring how male domination of women and of nature are interconnected. Arguing that these values must be changed, she develops potential ways for healing ourselves and our planet from within existing religious traditions. This work is useful for special collections in religion, woman's studies, and ecology. It assumes some relevant knowledge on the part of the reader but is highly relevant for this specialized audience.<br><i>- Marilyn E.

Holed up at his farmhouse in Scotland, he sank into a deep depression. To outsiders, McCartney seemed like a man adrift&#x2014;intimidated by his own fame, paralyzed by the choices that lay before him, cut loose from his musical moorings. But what appeared to be the sad finale of a glorious career was just the start of a remarkable second act.<br> &nbsp;<br> The product of a long series of one-on-one interviews between McCartney and Scottish rock journalist Tom Doyle, <i>Man on the Run</i> chronicles Paul McCartney&#x2019;s decadelong effort to escape the shadow of his past, outrace his critics, and defy the expectations of his fans. From the bitter and painful breakup of the Beatles to the sobering wake-up call of John Lennon&#x2019;s murder, this is a deeply revealing look at a sometimes frightening, often exhilarating period in the life of the world&#x2019;s most famous rock star.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sensing that he had nowhere to go but up, Paul McCartney started over from scratch. With emotional&#x2014;and musical&#x2014;backing from Linda, he released eccentric solo albums and embarked on a nomadic hippie lifestyle. He formed a new band, Wings, which first took flight on a ramshackle tour of British university towns and eventually returned Paul to the summit of arena rock superstardom.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>Man on the Run,</i> Doyle follows McCartney inside the recording sessions for Wings&#x2019; classic album <i>Band on the Run</i>&#x2014;and provides context for some of the baffling misfires in his discography. Doyle tracks the dizzying highs and exasperating lows of a life lived in the public spotlight: the richly excessive world tours, the Japanese drug bust that nearly ended McCartney&#x2019;s career, his bitter public feuds with his erstwhile Beatle bandmates, and the aftermath of an infamous drug-and-alcohol-fueled jam session where McCartney helped reconcile the estranged John Lennon and Yoko Ono. <br> &nbsp;<br> For Paul McCartney, the 1970s were a wild ride with some dark turns. Set against the backdrop of a turbulent decade, <i>Man on the Run</i> casts the &#x201c;sunny Beatle&#x201d; in an entirely new light.<br><br><b>Praise for<i> Man on the Run</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;&#x201c;Tom Doyle&#x2019;s detailed chronicle, which includes rare interviews with McCartney and former Wings members, portrays a band that was far more contentious than eager-to-please hits like 1976&#x2019;s &#x2018;Let &#x2019;Em In&#x2019; had us believe, fronted by a legend who wanted to be both boss and buddy. The book is larded with tales of Seventies rock-star excess, Paul and Linda&#x2019;s love of weed, docked paychecks, and grousing musicians.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Rolling Stone</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Well-researched but still breezy and engaging, the book offers a comprehensive tour of the shaggy, bleary-eyed decade when the hardest-working ex-Beatle reached the zenith of his creative and commercial success. . . . <i>Man on the Run</i> makes an excellent contribution to the burgeoning literature devoted to McCartney&#x2019;s post-Beatles career.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Boston Globe</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;In the 1970s, a depressed, heavy-drinking Paul McCartney walked away from The Beatles and reinvented himself as the leader of another hitmaking rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll band.

He flipped over onto his back and thought, Jesus . . . that was a bit near.<br><br>Day by day, week by week, his condition had been steadily worsening. His often sleepless nights were spent shaking with anxiety, while his days, which he was finding harder and harder to make it through, were characterized by heavy drinking and self-sedation with marijuana. He found himself chain-smoking his unfiltered, lung-blackening Senior Service cigarettes one after another after another.<br><br>Later, he would look back on this period and tell everyone that he&#x2019;d almost had a nervous breakdown. From the outside, there appeared to be no &#x201c;almost&#x201d; about it.<br><br>For the first time in his life, he felt utterly worthless. Everything he had been since the age of fifteen had been wrapped up in the band. Now, even though he couldn&#x2019;t tell the world, that period of his life was almost certainly over.<br><br>It was as if he&#x2019;d suddenly and unexpectedly lost his job, been made entirely redundant. He was twenty-seven and of no use to anyone anymore. Even the money he&#x2019;d earned up to this point was no comfort, made no real difference. This was an identity crisis in extremis: who exactly was he if he wasn&#x2019;t Beatle Paul McCartney?<br><br>On the mornings when he forced himself to rise, he&#x2019;d sit on the edge of his bed for a while before defeatedly crawling back under the covers. When he did get out of bed he&#x2019;d reach straight for the whiskey, his drinking creeping earlier and earlier into the day. By three in the afternoon, he was usually out of it.<br><br>&#x201c;I hit the bottle,&#x201d; he admits. &#x201c;I hit the substances.&#x201d;<br><br>He was eaten up with anger&#x2014;at himself, at the outside world. He could describe it only as a barreling, empty feeling rolling across his soul.<br><br>Out of work and with nothing to distract him, he was tormented by ghosts from his past; they would rise up, whispering in his head, telling him that, in spite of everything he&#x2019;d achieved, they knew he&#x2019;d never really amount to anything. That he should have found a proper job in the first place, just as they&#x2019;d always said.<br><br>He realized that up until this point he&#x2019;d been a &#x201c;cocky sod.&#x201d; And now there was this: the first serious blow to his confidence he&#x2019;d ever experienced. Even when he was fourteen and the complications from a mastectomy had suddenly taken his mother&#x2019;s life, he had understood that this horrific event had been beyond his control. Somehow, now, in the depths of his muddied thinking, he was starting to believe that everything that was happening was nobody&#x2019;s fault but his own.<br><br>His wife of less than a year later said she had felt the situation was &#x201c;frightening beyond belief.&#x201d; Within a matter of months, her new partner had gone from being a sparky, driven, world-famous rock star to a broken man who didn&#x2019;t want to set foot out of their bedroom. But even if Linda was scared, she knew she couldn&#x2019;t give up on Paul. She recognized that her husband was sinking into emotional quicksand, and she knew that it was down to her alone to pull him out before he went under for good.<br><br>&#x201c;Linda saved me,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;And it was all done in a sort of domestic setting.&#x201d;<br><br>It had been two years since they&#x2019;d first met, at the Bag O&#x2019; Nails nightclub in Soho, four days later being seen deep in conversation at the press launch for Sgt. Pepper. It was only a year since they&#x2019;d managed to float unnoticed together through the streets of New York (where, in Chinatown, he had comically tried to pull her into a temple offering Buddhist weddings) before flying from coast to coast, landing in Los Angeles and disappearing for days into a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel. It was still only six months since they&#x2019;d giggled their way through their wedding ceremony at Marylebone registry office in London, amid a fog of seething female jealousy that seemed to spread across the world.<br><br>He had been the last single Beatle, the one seen about town, haunting the clubs and hanging with the artsy crowd. She was the American single-mother divorc�e who had earned some renown as a rock photographer and who had apparently had flings with Mick Jagger and Jim Morrison. To Paul, Linda appeared deeper than the frothy, starry-eyed girls who tended to flock around him, less buttoned-up than his then paramour, the actress Jane Asher.<br><br>Linda would take Paul out on long drives, saying, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get lost&#x201d; in her drawly, spacey way, showing him a new kind of freedom. She had surprised him by telling him, &#x201c;I could make you a nice home.&#x201d;<br><br>Now it was the autumn of 1969, and the McCartneys were in Scotland, &#x201c;hiding away in the mists,&#x201d; as Paul puts it. They had escaped here, far from London and the heavy weather of intra-Beatle feuding that refused to lift.<br><br>But High Park Farm was no rock-star country pile. Paul had bought the run-down farmhouse, set on a hill overlooking Skeroblin Loch amid 183 acres of rough Scottish landscape, back in June 1966, the year he became a millionaire. His accountant had suggested that McCartney invest in property to wrestle some of his earnings away from the clutches of Harold Wilson and his Labour government&#x2019;s painful 95 percent taxing of high earners.<br><br>The ever frugal Paul, of course, leaped at such an opportunity, picking High Park Farm out of the reams of property documents his accountant sent him. The asking price was a not insubstantial �35,000, more than ten times the cost of the average family home in the mid-1960s. It was, says Paul, &#x201c;wee,&#x201d; consisting of only three rooms: a bedroom at either end separated by a combined kitchen and living area. The hole in the roof of the farmhouse was included in the deal.<br><br>But it was another eighteen months after the purchase, in December 1967, before Paul, with Jane Asher in tow, made the trip north to check out his new investment. High Park was set more than a mile up a bumpy dirt path and visitors unprepared for the terrain would moan that the drive would virtually wreck their offroad-unworthy vehicles.<br><br>The sorely neglected property was in a wild and windswept location, fourteen miles from the southern tip of the remote Kintyre Peninsula, in Argyll. Three miles west of the hill lay the six-mile sweep of beach at Machrihanish Bay. A five-mile drive southeast down the A83 sat the small fishing port of Campbeltown and the closest amenities.<br><br>At the tail-end of 1967&#x2014;equally the Beatles&#x2019; annus mirabilis and their annus horribilis (the marvel of Sgt. Pepper, the paralyzing shock of Brian Epstein&#x2019;s death, the trials of Magical Mystery Tour, and the sense that nothing would ever be the same again)&#x2014;McCartney tried to make High Park habitable on a characteristically thrifty level.<br><br>He dispatched Beatles gofer Alistair Taylor into Campbeltown; Taylor returned with a secondhand Formica table and chairs, an electric stove, and a couple of beds. The pair fashioned a sofa out of a pile of Sharpe&#x2019;s Express wooden potato boxes, with an old mattress found in the barn folded over the makeshift frame.<br><br>After his split from Asher, Paul first went back there with Linda in November 1968. The eldest daughter of the moneyed New York Eastman family had immediately fallen in love with the place and the idea of roughing it in this remoteness&#x2014;no hot water, mice and rats in the walls and all&#x2014;but had suggested to Paul that they do the place up a bit. It was a notion that hadn&#x2019;t even occurred to the airy McCartney.<br><br>She encouraged him to pour a cement floor in the kitchen, an improvement over the wooden planks laid over the bare earth. He began making a table to replace the flimsy Formica one. He scaled a ladder and climbed onto the roof to fix its hole, Linda soundtracking his handiwork by spinning the newly released Tighten Up reggae compilation LPs.<br><br>If you had walked through the door of the farmhouse in the latter months of 1969, according to Paul, you&#x2019;d have seen &#x201c;nappies, bottles, musical instruments, me and Lin, like a couple of hippies. . . . It wasn&#x2019;t sort of dirty, but it wasn&#x2019;t clean.&#x201d;<br><br>High Park wasn&#x2019;t entirely cut off from civilization, though it certainly had that feel. Linda in particular romanticized this notion, imagining that the McCartneys were living in another era, as if they were pioneers in this isolated place. She loved the fact that they were, as she fancifully saw it, &#x201c;at the end of nowhere.&#x201d;<br><br>As the months passed, Paul and Linda grew into their rural personas. At Christmas, he bought her twelve pheasants; she bought him a tractor, which he used to plow a vegetable patch, where they grew parsnips, turnips, potatoes, green beans, runner beans, and spinach.<br><br>Their acreage was home to 150 to 200 sheep, which Paul learned to clip using hand shears, after which they sold the fleeces to the Wool Marketing Board. Already leaning toward vegetarianism, they balked at the notion of killing their lambs, although they were forced to send some off to market when the numbers grew too high. They tried to separate the ewes from the rams, but sometimes one of the male sheep would enthusiastically spring over the fence. In time, they had six horses, including the retired racer Drake&#x2019;s Drum, bought for Paul&#x2019;s father, Jim, and a former winner at Aintree, alongside Honor (Paul&#x2019;s), Cinnamon (Linda&#x2019;s), and three ponies, Sugarfoot, Cookie, and Coconut.<br><br>Revving up a generator, Paul put together an ad hoc four-track recording facility in High Park&#x2019;s rickety lean-to, which he named Rude Studio. It was in here, gently encouraged by Linda, that his songwriting slowly began to return to him, as he effectively used music as therapy to alleviate his depression. &#x201c;She eased me out of it,&#x201d; he remembers, &#x201c;and just said, &#x2018;Hey, y&#x2019;know, you don&#x2019;t want to get too crazy.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Paul shied away from admitting that there was a strong autobiographical element to some of these new compositions, but his protestations rang hollow. The lyrics of &#x201c;Man We Was Lonely&#x201d; speak of how his and Linda&#x2019;s self-imposed exile was not as idyllic as it outwardly seemed, that their spirits had been low, but, under the comfort blanket of domesticity, their positivity was returning.<br><br>&#x201c;Every Night,&#x201d; a song he&#x2019;d first begun messing around with during the Let It Be sessions, was more confessional still&#x2014;its singer painting a grim picture of a routine involving getting wasted and struggling to drag himself out of bed. The chorus, as was increasingly becoming a McCartney trait, pledged his devotion to Linda. As a song, it was a deceptively breezy affair. While elsewhere Lennon was screaming his pain, it was typical of McCartney to mask his with melody. Only if you listened closely would you really be able to detect the songwriter&#x2019;s anguish.<br><br>As Paul seemed to stabilize, the McCartneys settled into a daily routine, riding their horses across the land or taking sheepdog Martha for long walks. They drove into Campbeltown in their Land Rover, which they&#x2019;d nicknamed Helen Wheels, the Beatle becoming a regular sight wandering around in his Wellies and sheepskin-lined brown leather jacket. In the evening, he would light the fire while Linda cooked, and then Paul would step into Rude to work on songs. At night, they would cuddle up, get stoned, and watch TV. &#x201c;We were not cut off from the world,&#x201d; said Linda. &#x201c;We were never hermits.&#x201d;<br><br>In addition, to playfully distract Paul from his troubles, there were the children to look after: the newborn Mary and Linda&#x2019;s child from her first marriage, shy Heather, only six. For the kids, High Park was a cross between a playground and a junkyard. As soon as she began to walk, Mary was free to toddle outside, through its abandoned gypsy encampment&#x2013;like clutter of scrap wood, sheets of corrugated iron, and teetering log piles (noting incredulously as an adult that she&#x2019;d effectively been brought up in a &#x201c;lumber yard&#x201d;).<br><br>It was a messy scene but, for McCartney, one filled with increasingly frequent spells of happiness. Nevertheless, in a corner of his mind, knowing that there was a Beatles-shaped storm brewing back down in London, Paul was still plagued with unease.<br><br>It didn&#x2019;t help that everyone was arguing about whether or not he was dead.<br><br>The rumor had first circulated among the bloodshot-eyed student populace of Drake University in Iowa, around the time McCartney had first holed up in Scotland. The signs were all there if you cared to dig &#x201c;deep&#x201d; enough, to stop just rolling joints on the covers of Beatles albums and decipher the hidden messages in the artwork and between the grooves. The students listened to Lennon&#x2019;s daft murmur of &#x201c;cranberry sauce&#x201d; in the fade-out of &#x201c;Strawberry Fields Forever&#x201d; and imagined it to be &#x201c;I buried Paul.&#x201d; They would spin The White Album backward with an index finger and convince themselves that a voice could be heard saying, &#x201c;Turn me on, dead man.&#x201d;<br><br>In many ways, the Beatles had brought this upon themselves. In their touring absence and with their increasingly cryptic music, they had laid playful clues and red herrings: with the opening lines of &#x201c;Rain&#x201d; played backward at the end of the song; with the garbled, wonked-out voices locked in the play-out groove of side 2 of Sgt. Pepper; with Lennon&#x2019;s head-game assertion in &#x201c;Glass Onion&#x201d; that the walrus was Paul.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d done them for fun, just for something to do,&#x201d; says Paul, in admitting the Beatles&#x2019; surprise that their penchant for japery was taken so seriously. &#x201c;Then everyone analyzed them and we thought, Ah. We were completely oblivious to all those other &#x2018;hidden&#x2019; messages.&#x201d;<br><br>That was until the clueheads began to air their tangential theories. September 16, 1969, saw the first piece, in the Drake University student paper, under the tantalizing headline &#x201c;Is Paul McCartney Dead?&#x201d; A week later, the Northern Star, the campus rag of Northern Illinois University, went one better: &#x201c;Clues Hint at Possible Beatle Death.&#x201d;<br><br>A student identifying himself only as Tom called Detroit DJ Russ Gibb to inform him of the rumors. Listening in, a college writer named Fred LaBour decided to turn prankster, taking it upon himself to &#x201c;kill&#x201d; McCartney, adding arm upon leg to the growing myth. Two days later, the Michigan Daily printed his fabricated revelations under a more contentious banner: &#x201c;McCartney Dead: New Evidence Brought to Light.&#x201d; The rumor spread countrywide when Roby Yonge, on his networked show from WABC in New York, discussed the theories on the air in the small hours, when the stoned were at their most receptive.</p><h2>Half an Inch of Water: Stories</h2><p><p><b>A new collection of stories set in the West from "one of the most gifted and versatile of contemporary writers" (NPR)</b><br><b></b><br>Percival Everett's long-awaited new collection of stories, his first since 2004's <i>Damned If I Do</i>, finds him traversing the West with characteristic restlessness. A deaf Native American girl wanders off into the desert and is found untouched in a den of rattlesnakes.

If anything, Mr. Guthrie Hayes seemed even less appealing after that effort. He certainly didn't look like the war hero her student had told her about with such excitement.<br><br>A muscular man, probably only a few inches taller than Caroline herself, he sat at a corner table, engrossed in a game of cards. A mangy yellow dog lay at his side on the sawdust floor, its muzzle resting on its paws. Mr. Hayes wore rough-spun trousers, a plain shirt of undyed cotton, suspenders, and a leather hat that looked as if it had been chewed up and spit out by a large, irritable animal. His face was beard-stubbled, and he sported a rakish black patch over one eye.<br><br>Caroline couldn't see his hair, because of the hat, but she figured it was probably too long. She sighed, dampened a clean corner of the hanky with her tongue, and cleared a bigger area on the glass.<br><br>Just then one of the men at Mr. Hayes's table must have pointed Caroline out, for he raised his head and looked her directly in the eyes. An unaccountable shock jolted her system; she sensed something hidden deep in this man's mind and spirit, something beautiful and deadly.<br><br>He had the audacity to smile around the stub of a thin cigar clamped between his strong white teeth. As far as Caroline was willing to admit, those teeth were his only redeeming feature.<br><br>Mr. Hayes spoke cordially to the other men, threw in his cards, and pushed back his chair. The dog got up to follow him as he came toward the swinging doors.<br><br>Caroline stepped back, alarm and excitement colliding inside her and driving out her breath. Her fingers trembled a little as she stuffed the soiled hanky into her handbag. She squared her shoulders and lifted her chin, even though she was patently terrified.<br><br>Mr. Hayes approached her idly, the cigar stub still caught between his teeth. In the bright sunshine of an April afternoon, Caroline saw that his one visible eye was green, and she just assumed the other was, too -- provided there was another one, of course. There was a quirky slant to his mouth, and his beard, like what she could see of his hair, was light brown.<br><br>His very presence had an impact, despite his appearance.<br><br>"Ma'am," he said, touching the brim of his seedy hat, and Caroline heard just the whisper of a southern drawl in the way he uttered the word.<br><br>She drew a deep breath and let it out slowly. Lord knew, she wanted nothing to do with the likes of Guthrie Hayes, but he might well be Seaton's only chance. She was prepared to do almost anything to help the man she hoped to marry.<br><br>She put out a hand. "My name is Miss Caroline Chalmers," she said.<br><br>An impudent green eye moved over her slender figure slowly then came back to her face. The amusement Caroline saw in its depths nettled her, and she felt a peculiar sort of sweet venom spread through her.<br><br>"What can I do for you, Miss Caroline Chalmers?" Just behind him, the yellow dog whimpered forlornly and kerplopped to its belly on the dirty wooden sidewalk.<br>par<br><br>Caroline ran her tongue over dry lips, and even though her errand was urgent, she was compelled to hedge. "Is that animal ill?" she asked.<br><br>"Tob?" Hayes chuckled, and the sound was warm and rich. It hid itself in Caroline's middle and melted there, like beeswax left in the sun. "Not really. He's just hung over -- bad habit he picked up before he and I became partners."<br><br>Caroline took a step backwards and felt her cheeks redden. Inside the saloon, a tinny piano made a <i>chinky-tinky</i> sound, and wagons and buggies rattled through the mud-and-manure-filled street. "Tob is a very strange name," she managed to say. "Why do you call him that?"<br><br>Mr. Hayes sighed in a long-suffering fashion, probably yearning to get back to his debauched pursuits inside the Hellfire and Spit Saloon, took off his hat, and put it back on again. In the interim, Caroline caught a glimpse of tousled brown hair with a golden glint to it.<br><br>"Miss Chalmers," he said, with irritating patience, "I didn't come out here to discuss my dog. What do you want?"<br><br>Caroline's cheeks went even redder, and out of the comer of her eye, she thought she saw Hypatia Furvis peering at her through the window of the dress shop. Before sunset, every warm body in Bolton would have been told that the schoolteacher had been seen talking to a man who was hardly more than a criminal.<br><br>"Miss Chalmers?" Mr. Hayes prompted.<br><br>"Is it true that you used to -- to rescue people from Federal prisons, during the war?"<br><br>He took a match from the pocket of his shirt, struck it against the sole of one scuffed boot, and lit the cigar stub. Clouds of blue smoke billowed into Caroline's face, fouling the fresh spring air. "Who told you that?"<br><br>Caroline coughed. "One of my students," she admitted.<br><br>A mischievous grin lifted one corner of his mouth. "I thought you looked like a schoolteacher," he said, and once more, his brazen gaze took in her figure. "You're surely a scrawny little thing. Don't they pay you enough to buy food?"<br><br>Caroline was patently insulted. Maybe she wasn't fashionably plump, but she wasn't exactly thin, either. She took another deep breath to show that she had a bosom, however modest. "My wages are adequate, thank you. In fact, they allow me to offer you a sizable sum in return for your help."<br><br>Hayes took a puff of the cigar. "How sizable?"<br><br>"Two hundred and thirty-six dollars and forty-seven cents," Caroline replied, with dignity. She'd saved literally from childhood to amass what she considered a small fortune. And she loved Seaton Flynn enough to hand over every penny in return for his freedom.<br><br>He gave a slow whistle and shook his head. "That's a lot of money, Miss Chalmers. Exactly what would I have to do to earn it?"<br><br>Caroline looked carefully in every direction, then dropped her voice to a whisper to reply, "I want you to free my -- friend from jail."<br><br>The eye narrowed, and Mr. Hayes tossed the cigar into the street. "What did you say?"<br><br>Caroline bit her lower lip for a moment, then repeated her request, slowly and clearly, the way she would have done for a slow student.<br><br>"I'll be damned," swore Mr. Hayes, resting his hands on his hips. "You're asking me to break the law!"<br><br>"Shhh!" Caroline hissed. Then she took his arm and fairly dragged him into the little space between the Hellfire and Spit Saloon and the Wells Fargo office. There was no telling what Hypatia would make of that, but Caroline felt she had no alternative. "You wouldn't be breaking the law," she insisted furiously, still gripping Mr. Hayes's arm. "You'd be striking a blow for justice. Seaton -- Mr. Flynn is innocent. He was wrongly accused." Tears welled, unbidden, along her lashes. "They're going to hang him!"<br><br>There was a certain cautious softening in Mr. Hayes's manner. His dog was at his side again, nuzzling the back of his knee. "I read about that in the newspaper," Hayes said with a frown, rubbing his bristly chin with a thumb and forefinger.<br><br>Desperation kept Caroline from remarking on the surprising fact that Mr. Hayes could read. "He didn't rob that stagecoach," she whispered frantically. "And I know he didn't gun down the driver. Mr. Flynn would never do a reprehensible thing like that."<br><br>Mr. Hayes looked both pitying and skeptical, and Caroline wanted to slap his face for it, but she restrained herself.<br><br>"What makes you so sure?" he asked.<br><br>Caroline huffed out a ragged, beleaguered sigh. "Because he <i>told</i> me he didn't!"<br><br>Hayes spread his hands wide. "Well, why didn't you say so?" he retorted sarcastically. "That changes everything!"<br><br>Caroline sniffled. The tip of her nose was probably turning red, but she didn't care. Practically everything that mattered to her was at stake. "If Mr. Flynn can just get out of jail, he can prove his innocence."<br><br>"Or hightail it for the ass-end of nowhere," Hayes agreed. "Flynn was convicted of robbery and murder, Miss Chalmers. He was sentenced to hang. And there isn't a damn thing I can do about it." He turned to walk away, and Caroline gripped the back of his sleeve.<br><br>"Wait," she pleaded. "Please."<br><br>He faced her again. "Breaking into Yankee jails during wartime was one thing, Miss Chalmers. But now the fighting is over, and I've got no intention of getting in the way of justice."<br><br>"Justice?" Caroline cried. "The territory's about to execute the wrong man! Do you call that justice?"<br><br>Hayes hooked one thumb under a suspender and regarded Caroline thoughtfully. "You really love this jaybird, don't you?"<br><br>"Yes," Caroline admitted, in a whispered wail. The dog at Mr. Hayes's feet seemed to echo the sound.<br><br>"Hell," cursed Mr. Hayes. "I do powerfully hate it when a lady cries."<br><br>Since her handkerchief was filthy, Caroline had to dry her eyes with the back of one hand. "Will you help me?"<br><br>"No," Mr. Hayes answered flatly. And then he walked away, the pitiful dog scrambling along at his heels.<br><br>Caroline took a few moments to recover her dignity, then followed him. That snoopy Hypatia was standing out on the sidewalk in front of her Aunt Gertrude's shop now, her arms folded, watching with a smirk on her face.<br><br>"Hello, Caroline!" she called out in a sunny voice.<br><br>Caroline only glared at her and went back to the saloon window.<br><br>Guthrie Hayes was once again embroiled in his card game. As Caroline watched, a dance hall girl in a skimpy pink and black striped dress minced her way over the sawdust toward him, carrying an enameled bowl in one hand.<br><br>Reaching the table, she picked up a whiskey bottle and poured the amber-colored liquor into the bowl. She set the dish on the floor, showing her garters when she bent over. The dog drank the whiskey in shameless laps, then lay down at Mr. Hayes's feet again.<br><br>Caroline wasn't concerned with the dog's apparent lack of moral fortitude. It was the dance hall girl who irked her. While she watched, the shameless hussy sat down in Mr. Hayes's lap with a distinct wiggle and wrapped one arm around his neck.<br><br>For the moment, Seaton Flynn and his predicament were forgotten.<br><br>The harlot took Mr. Hayes's hat from his head and put it on her own, then bent to whisper something in his ear while he dealt the cards.<br><br>Caroline tapped insistently at the window, but Mr. Hayes's attention was all for the strumpet squirming and simpering in his lap.<br><br>A slow grin spread across his face as he listened to whatever the soiled dove was saying and then he nodded in response. In that moment, Caroline lost all concern for appearances and marched along the sidewalk to the swinging doors.<br><br>Without stopping to think -- if she had paused to consider the implications of her actions, she wouldn't have had the courage -- Caroline strode into the saloon, her prim black shoes kicking up little clouds of sawdust as she moved.<br><br>The bawdy tinkle of the piano ceased, as did the clinking of bottles against glass and the low hum of conversation.<br><br>Everyone turned to stare blearily at Caroline through a blue haze of smoke as she came to a halt beside Mr. Hayes's chair and folded her arms.<br><br>Tob whined and put one paw over his muzzle. Mr. Hayes looked up at her and grinned, and the dance hall girl, still wearing the hat, gazed at Caroline with a combination of challenge and contempt in her saucy, kohl-lined eyes.<br><br>The impetus that had swept Caroline into the saloon promptly deserted her, and she was at a total loss. After all, she couldn't very well argue her case in front of all these witnesses; the whole plan depended upon the utmost discretion.<br><br>"Mr. Hayes," she said awkwardly, operating on sheer bravado, "I demand that you speak with me. Privately."<br><br>He arched one eyebrow, his arm resting nonchalantly around the saloon girl's middle. Playfully, she put the hat back on his head. "Oh, you do, do you? What about?"<br><br>Caroline"s face was flooded with color. "You know very well <i>what about,</i> Mr. Hayes. You are simply being difficult."<br><br>Much too gently for Caroline's tastes, he displaced the young woman on his lap and stood. "I believe I made myself clear when we talked before, Miss Chalmers," he said evenly, hooking his thumbs in his suspenders.<br><br>Caroline was terrified. If he repeated the request she'd made of him in front of these people, all would be lost. She might even end up in jail herself.<br><br>Almost suavely, he gestured toward the swinging doors, inviting her to leave.<br><br>Chin trembling, Caroline turned on her heel, picked up her skirts with one hand, and stormed out of the saloon and down the sidewalk.<br><br>She didn't stop to think about what she'd done until she reached the picket fence surrounding the brick schoolhouse three streets away. Pushing open the gate, Caroline stumbled blindly up the walk, one hand to her mouth, and let herself into the building.<br><br>All her students were gone for the day, since she'd dismissed classes before venturing to the saloon in search of Mr. Hayes, so she had the privacy to cry.<br><br>She sat down on one of the small desks, attached to each other by long runners of black iron, covered her face with both hands, and wept in earnest. She hadn't felt this bleak or hopeless since that long-ago day in Nebraska, when she'd been forced to leave Emma and Lily behind on the orphan train.<br><br>With Seaton Flynn, a handsome young lawyer who had appeared in town on the afternoon stagecoach one day two years before, she'd found the hope of a home and children of her own, a real family. He'd charmed her easily, with his dancing brown eyes and ready smile -- he had a grand sense of fashion and propriety, too, unlike Mr. Guthrie Hayes -- and he'd soon built a respectable practice. Although Caroline had caught glimpses of a cold, quicksilver temper in Seaton, she'd felt that his good qualities outweighed such a transitory flaw.<br><br>Then he'd been accused of robbing a stagecoach and actually shooting another person to death! Seaton had been whisked away to Laramie, tried, and convicted, but Caroline was convinced it was all a colossal mistake. She loved Seaton Flynn, and that wouldn't have been the case if he were a murderer and a thief. She would have known.<br><br>When the door creaked open behind her, interrupting her reflections, Caroline thought one of her students had returned for a forgotten book or slate. She sniffled once, lifted her chin, and scraped up a smile to put on. But when she turned to look, she saw Guthrie Hayes standing at the back of the schoolroom.<br><br>Instantly, the room was too warm. Caroline bolted off the desk top and went to take a long pole from its hook on the wall. Her heart pounding at a rate all out of proportion to the activity, she went from one high window to another, opening them from the top.<br><br>Soon, there was nothing to do but face Mr. Hayes again. "What do you want?" she asked.<br><br>He was still standing in the framework of the inner door, next to the entrance to the cloakroom, one powerful shoulder resting against the jamb. "You've been crying over Flynn," he said seriously. "Has it ever occurred to you that he might not be worth your tears?"<br><br>Caroline thought of picnics and long Sunday afternoon walks with Seaton Flynn, of shared kisses in the moonlight and her many bright dreams. Caroline's heart had gone tumbling into infinity the first moment she saw him, w...</p><h2>NIV Application Commentary 1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians</h2><p><p>Most Bible commentaries take us on a one-way trip from our world to the world of the Bible.

(His very first (rejected) comics story dealt with the subject, as does his most recent work, the two-volume <i>Putain de Guerre</i>.) But <i>It Was the War of the Trenches</i> is Tardi's defining, masterful statement on the subject. Tardi is not interested in the national politics, the strategies, or the battles: he focuses on the day to day of the grunts in the trenches, and, with icy, controlled fury and disgust, with sardonic yet deeply sympathetic narration, he brings that existence alive as no one has before or since. Yet he also delves deeply into the underlying causes of the war, the madness, the cynical political exploitation of patriotism. And in a final, heartbreaking coda, Tardi grimly itemizes the ghastly human cost of the war, and lays out the future 20th century conflicts, all of which seem to spring from this global burst of insanity. <i>Trenches</i> features some of Tardi's most stunning artwork. Rendered in a lush illustrative style, inspired both by abundant photographic documentation and classic American war comics, augmented by a sophisticated, gorgeous use of Craftint tones, <i>Trenches</i> is somehow simultaneously atypical for the artist and a perfect encapsulation of Tardi's mature style. It is the indisputable centerpiece of Tardi's oeuvre. <br><br></p><p>Tardi is a pioneering European cartoonist. His Adele Blanc-Sec series was adapted into a feature by Luc Besson, and he was behind the recent animated film&nbsp;April and the&nbsp;Extraordinary World. His comics are award-winning (including the U.S.'s Eisners).&nbsp;He lives in Paris with his wife, the singer Dominique Grange, and their cats.&#x201c;Starred Review. While the visuals, which draw upon battlefield photographs, are thoroughly convincing, the soldiers&#x2019; harrowing experiences, fictionalized by Tardi, register as even more powerfully authentic. The potency of the soldiers&#x2019; tragic stories is enhanced by the elegance of Tardi&#x2019;s lucid drawing and keen compositions that are accentuated by the use of three horizontal panels per page throughout. This masterful condemnation of the cruelty and stupidity of war, created over the course of a decade, from 1982 to 1993, is a <em>cri de coeur</em> that stands out even amid Tardi&#x2019;s impressive body of work.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Tardi&#x2019;s tales from World War I capture the morbid drudgery that is trench warfare and finds pockets of profundity that speak to the nature of war and man.

One of the most remarkable things about this extraordinary woman was her prolific correspondence with her cherished team of children's book authors and illustrators, all of whom she liked to call "Genius." Fortunately, many of her letters--warm, witty, temperamental, flattering, extravagant, self-deprecating, sympathetic, and always human--have been culled from HarperCollins's archives, gathered from many generous individuals, and arranged in chronological order by the noted biographer and critic Leonard S. Marcus. The result is <i>Dear Genius: The Letters of Ursula Nordstrom</i>, complete with black-and-white photographs, extensive footnotes, a bibliography, and an index. <p> In this fascinating behind-the-scenes look at children's book publishing, letters to Shel Silverstein, Maurice Sendak, Laura Ingalls Wilder, John Steptoe, and Kay Thompson reveal a woman on an unorthodox quest to wrench children's literature from the stultifying clutches of sentimental illusion and false piety. Her dedication to creative, honest, original, non-condescending books for children changed the landscape of children's literature forever. As Marcus writes in his introduction, "...her letters have much to tell about the arts of writing, illustrating, and editing; the social history of the twentieth century; and the pivotal role that books, and a love of books, can play in children's lives. To read the letters is to receive a many-faceted education from a teacher of rare insight, good humor, and lively humanity. I am glad that readers will now be able to share in the experience."</p><p>Leonard S.

He looked at the clock in surprise; it was already 6:00 p.m. During the winter months, darkness descended and reminded him to close up shop, but the daylight savings time change necessitated an alarm clock to let him know when it was time to leave. Otherwise, he'd get lost in his computer and never find his way home.<br><br>He rose from his chair, stretched, turned off the computer and reached for his messenger bag. What a day. What a long and glorious day.<br><br>He took his garbage with him; his lunch leavings. There was no reason to have leftover banana peels in his trash can overnight. He shut off the lights, locked the door, dropped the plastic Publix bag into the Dumpster, and began the two-block walk to his parking spot. His white Prius was one of the few cars left in the lot.<br><br>Gavin listened to his iPod on the way out of downtown. Traffic was testy, as always, so he waited patiently, crawling through West End, then took the exit for I-40 and headed, slowly, toward Memphis. The congestion cleared right past White Bridge, and he sailed the rest of the way.<br><br>The drive took twenty-two minutes, he clocked it. Not too bad.<br><br>He left the highway at McCrory Lane and went to his gym. The YMCA lot was full, as always. He checked in, changed clothes in the locker room, ran for forty-five minutes, worked on the elliptical for twenty, did one hundred inverted crunches and shadow boxed for ten minutes. Then he toweled himself off. He retrieved the messenger bag, left his sneakers in the locker, slipped his feet back into the fluorescent orange rubber Crocs he'd been wearing all day. He left his gym clothes on&#x2014;they would go straight into the wash.<br><br>He went across the street to Publix, bought a single chicken cordon bleu and a package of instant mashed potatoes, a tube of hearty buttermilk biscuits, fresh bananas and cat food. He took his groceries, went to his car, and drove away into the night. He hadn't seen a soul. His mind was engaged with what waited for him at home.<br><br>Dark. Lonely. Empty.<br><br>Gavin pulled into the rambler-style house at 8:30 p.m. His cat, a Burmese gray named Art, met him at the door, loudly protesting his empty bowl. He spooned wet food into the cat's dish as a special treat before he did anything else. No reason for Art to be miserable. The cat ate with his tail high in the air, purring and growling softly.<br><br>He hit play on his stereo, and the strains of Dvor�k spilled through his living room. He stood for a moment, letting the music wash over him, his right arm moving in concert with the bass. The music filled him, made him complete, and whole. Art came and stood beside him, winding his tail around Gavin's leg. He smiled at the interruption, bent and scratched the cat behind the ears. Art arched his back in pleasure.<br><br>Evening's ritual complete, Gavin turned on the oven, sprinkled olive oil in a glass dish and put the chicken in to bake. It would take forty-five minutes to cook.<br><br>He showered, checked his work e-mail on his iPhone, then ate. He took his time; the chicken was especially good this evening. He sipped an icy Corona Light with a lime stuck in the neck.<br><br>He washed up. 10:00 p.m. now. He gave himself permission. He'd been a very good boy.<br><br>The padlock on the door to the basement was shiny with promise and lubricant. He inserted the key, twisting his wrist to keep it from jangling. He took the lock with him, holding it gingerly so he didn't get oil on his clothes. Oil was nearly impossible to get out. He made sure Art wasn't around; he didn't like the cat to get into the basement. He saw him sitting on the kitchen table, looking mournfully at the empty spot where Gavin's plate had rested.<br><br>Inside the door, the stairs led to blackness. He flipped a switch and light flooded the stairwell. He slipped the end of the lock in the inside latch, then clicked it home. No sense taking chances.<br><br>She was asleep. He was quiet, so he wouldn't wake her. He just wanted to look, anyway.<br><br>The Plexiglas cage was the shape of a coffin with a long clear divider down the length&#x2014;creating two perfectly sized compartments&#x2014;with small drainage holes in the bottom and air holes along the top. It stood on a reinforced platform he had built himself. The concrete floor had a drain; all he needed to do was sluice water across the opening and presto, clean. He ran the water for a few minutes, clearing out the debris, then looked back to his love.<br><br>Her lips were cracking, the hair shedding. She'd been without food and water for a week now, and she was spending more and more time asleep. Her lethargy was anticipated. He looked forward to the moment when her agonies were at an end. He had no real desire to torture her. He just needed her heart to stop. Then, he could have her.<br><br>He licked his lips and felt embarrassed by his erection.<br><br>He breathed in the scent of her, reveling in the musky sweetness of her dying flesh, then went to the desk in the corner of the basement. No spiders and dust and basement rot for Gavin. The place was clean. Pristine.<br><br>The computer, a Mac Air he'd indulged in as a late Christmas present to himself, sprang to life. A few taps of the keyboard, the wireless system engaged and he was online. Before he had a chance to scroll through his bookmarks, his iChat chimed. The user's screen name was IlMorte69. He and Gavin were very good friends. Gavin responded, his own screen name, hot4cold, popping up in red ten-point Arial.<br><br>My dollhouse is nearly complete, Hot. Howz urs?<br><br>Hey, Morte. Mine's on its last legs as well. I'm here checking. Your trip go well?<br><br>My friend, I can't tell you. Such a wonderful time. But it's good to be home.<br><br>New dolls?<br><br>One. Luscious. Easy pickings. Like taking a rat from a cellar.<br><br>Gavin cringed. Sometimes Morte got to be a little much. But what could you do? It was hard for Gavin to talk to people, the online world was his oyster, his outlet. He had other friends who weren't quite as crude as Morte.<br><br>Speaking of which...he glanced at the listing of contacts and saw Necro90 was online as well. He sent him a quick hello, then went back to his chat with Morte.<br><br>When do you think you'll be ready?<br><br>Morte came back almost immediately.<br><br>Within two days. Did you do it like we discussed? You were more careful with the disposal than with the snatch, weren't you?<br><br>Gavin bristled a tiny bit, then relaxed. Morte was right to chide him. After all, he had made a mistake. He'd quickly learned that following Morte's every instruction was important. Very, very important.<br><br>Yes. It was perfect. I'll send you a photo.<br><br>He uploaded the shots, breath quickening in remembrance. So beautiful. Within moments, Morte responded.<br><br>My God. That is perfect. Lovely. You've become quite an artist.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Gavin blushed. Receiving compliments gracefully wasn't one of his strongest attributes. He glanced over his shoulder, knew he needed to wrap this up.<br><br>Morte, I've gotta run. Long day today.<br><br>I'll bet. You be good. Don't forget, two days and counting. I'll expect pictures!<br><br>Bye.<br><br>A picture flooded his screen&#x2014;Morte had sent him a gift. Gavin studied the photo; his ears burned. Oh, Morte was amazingly good with a camera. So much better than he was.<br><br>Morte's doll had no animation, no movement. Her eyes were shut. Gavin turned his chair around so he could stare at his own dollhouse, his own doll, lying in the darkness. Alone. He'd need to find her another friend soon. If only Morte's girl was a sister. He didn't have a taste for white meat.<br><br>Another chime&#x2014;this time it was Necro responding. He asked how Gavin was doing, if there'd been any news in the community. Gavin replied with a negative&#x2014;he'd heard nothing. Of course, his ear wasn't to the floor like Morte&#x2014;Morte was the architect of their online world. Gavin had found his friends deep in a sleepy sex message board, and was so thrilled to have them. They made his life bearable.<br><br>He chatted for a few minutes with Necro, read a rambling account of a perfect specimen Necro had sighted on some white-sand Caribbean beach, then logged out. He stared at the photo he'd downloaded from Morte. He was overwhelmingly turned on, and no longer able to contain himself. With a last glance at his doll, he went up the stairs, unlocked the door, locked the basement behind him and returned to his life. It was time for another shower, then bed. He had a very busy day ahead of him. A very busy few days. The plan was in motion.<br><br>He was proud of himself. He only checked the doll's breathing three times during the night.<br><br>Taylor Jackson was happy to spy an empty parking spot halfway up Thirty-second Avenue. Luck was on her side tonight. Parking in Nashville was extremely hit-or-miss, especially in West End. The valet smiled hopefully as she turned in front of Tin Angel, but she couldn't leave a state vehicle with a kid who didn't look old enough to have a driver's license, not without getting into all kinds of trouble. She drove past him, paralleled smoothly and walked the slight hill back down to the restaurant's entrance. She was looking forward to the evening, a girls' night with her best friend Sam and colleague Paula Simari. No homicides. No crime scenes. Just a low-key meal, some wine, some chicken schnitzel. A night off.<br><br>She was early, her friends hadn't arrived yet. She followed the hostess to a table for four right by the bricked fireplace. The logs were stacked tightly and burning slow, putting out a pleasant low, smoky heat. Even though the weather was warming, it was still nippy in the early mornings and late evenings.<br><br>She ordered a bottle of Coppola Merlot, accepted a menu, then lost herself in thought. The envelope she'd addressed before she left for dinner was burning a hole in her pocket. She took it out and stared at the lettering, wishing she didn't recognize the handwriting. Wishing she didn't have to address letters to federal penitentiaries, even if they were the chinos and golf-shirt variety.<br><br>Winthrop Jackson, IV<br><br>FCI MORGANTOWN<br><br>FEDERAL CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION<br><br>P.O.

And she'd been the one who put him there. Glancing to make sure no one was looking, she slid the single handwritten page from its nest.<br><br>Dear Win,<br><br>I am sorry. I know you understand I was just doing my job. I had no choice. I would appreciate it if you would stop trying to contact me. I find our relationship impossible to handle, and I want to get on with my life. Mom is still in Europe, but she has her cell phone. She can send you the money you need.<br><br>For what it's worth, I do forgive you. I know you couldn't help yourself. You never have.<br><br>Taylor<br><br>"Whatcha reading? You look upset."<br><br>Taylor started. Sam took the seat across from her, dropped her Birkin bag on the floor under the table and stretched her fingers, the joints popping slightly. She grimaced.<br><br>"Holding a scalpel all day does that to you. What's that?"<br><br>Taylor shook the page lightly. "A letter to Win."<br><br>"Really? I thought you'd sworn off dear old dad. Did you order some wine?"<br><br>"I did. It should be here any minute. Where's Paula?"<br><br>"She got called to a case. Sends her apologies. She'll catch us next week. It's just us chickens tonight."<br><br>Sam settled back into the chair, the firelight glinted red off her dark hair. Taylor still wasn't used to the blunt-cut bangs that swooped across Sam's forehead. She'd cropped her tresses into a sophisticated bob, what she called her mom do. Taylor thought she looked less like a mom and more like Betty Page with that cut, but who was she to comment?<br><br>"What are you staring at?"<br><br>"Sorry. The hair. It's so different. Takes me a minute."<br><br>"You have no idea how easy it is. Though I do miss long hair. Simon does too."<br><br>"I thought about cutting mine. When I mentioned it, Baldwin had a fit."<br><br>The wine arrived and they placed their orders. They clinked their glasses together, and Sam said, "Up to it, down to it."<br><br>Taylor laughed. They'd started that toast in eighth grade. <em>Up to it, down to it, damn the man who can't do it.... </em>The rest of the toast was a crude allusion to their future lovers' skill, though they had no idea what it meant at the time. In high school Taylor had embarrassed herself at one of her parents' many dinner parties by leading a toast with it. When the men roared and the women blushed, her mother, Kitty, had taken her aside and explained why that wasn't an appropriate thing for a young lady of breeding to say. She wouldn't tell her why, though, and Taylor and Sam puzzled over it for days. Now, as a woman, she understood, and always laughed at the memory of her disgrace.<br><br>She thought of Win then, and sobered.<br><br>"I'm trying to shut Win down, Sam. He keeps mailing, keeps calling. I don't want anything to do with him. He's poison, and I need to get him out of my life. What if Baldwin and I have children one day? Can you imagine ole jailbird gramps telling stories at Christmas dinner? He'll either corrupt them or embarrass them."<br><br>"You're thinking of having kids?"<br><br>"Focus, woman. We're talking about my dad."<br><br>"You'd make a great mother."<br><br>Taylor stared hard at her best friend. "Why do you say that?"<br><br>"Please. You're totally the nurturing type. You just don't know it yet. You'll be like a bear with its cub, or a tiger. Nothing, and no one, will harm a hair on your kid's head. Trust me, you'll take to it like a seal to water. When might this magnificent event take place, anyway?"<br><br>"You mean my immaculate conception?"<br><br>Sam laughed. "Baldwin's still in Quantico, I take it."<br><br>"Yes. He gets back tonight. That's why I wanted to meet downtown. I'm going to head to the airport from dinner."<br><br>"You miss him when he's gone, don't you?" Sam smiled at her, a grin of understanding. Taylor had never needed a man to feel complete, but when she'd gotten involved with John Baldwin, she suddenly felt every moment without him keenly.<br><br></p><h2>Love In Action: Writings on Nonviolent Social Change</h2><p><i>Love in Action</i> is a collection of over two decades of Thich Nhat Hanh&#x2019;s writing on nonviolence, peace, and reconciliation.

As the black bear population rebounded from a critical low in the 1970s, conservation efforts resulted in increased human-bear interactions. To learn about bears' habits, scientists fit bears with a radio collar and GPS tracking device and check on them periodically to observe their physical condition. Such field work requires patience and stamina to collect data to help answer questions about how bear behavior, diet, and size may change in urban settings. One unexpected finding is the tolerance most Asheville residents exhibit toward the increased bear population. Cherrix offers brief accounts of other human-animal relations, from leopards in Mumbai to wild boars in Berlin to feral chickens in Hawaii. She also includes short interviews with the scientists, tips for dealing with bears, explanations of GPS tracking, and related topics. Numerous photos accompany the engaging text. Another recent book on urban wildlife, Michelle Mulder's Going Wild: Helping Nature Thrive in Cities, stresses children's involvement.

How is it to be explained? Why do human beings believe in divinities? Why do the beliefs and behaviors we typically describe as religious so deeply affect the human personality and so subtly weave their way through human society?<br><br><em>Introducing Religion: Readings from the Classic Theorists</em> presents eleven key texts from influential theorists who played a pivotal role in the modern enterprise of explaining the phenomenon of religion. These writings seek to account for the origin, function, and enduring human appeal of religion by drawing on methods of scientific scholarship unconstrained by theological creeds or confessional commitments.<br> An ideal companion to author Daniel L. Pals' textbook, <em>Eight Theories of Religion,</em> Second Edition, or other beginning texts, <em>Introducing Religion</em> opens with selections from the works of Edward Burnett Tylor and James Frazer--Victorian pioneers in anthropology and the comparative study of religion. It then offers entry into the provocative analyses of Sigmund Freud, Emile Durkheim, and Karl Marx, whose aggressive reductionist approaches framed the explanatory debate for much of the century to follow. Responses to reductionist theories--and new directions in explanation--claim a place in selections from the works of philosopher-psychologist William James, theologian Rudolf Otto, sociologist Max Weber, and comparativist Mircea Eliade. The volume ends with discussions drawn from the celebrated field studies of British anthropologist E. E. Evans-Pritchard and the interpretive anthropology of American theorist Clifford Geertz, whose fieldwork took him to both Asia and the Middle East. Brief career portraits of the theorists at the outset of each chapter give context to the readings, and a general introduction features guiding questions designed to help students assess and compare the different theories.<br> Offering an illuminating overview of this controversial and engaging subject, <em>Introducing Religion: Readings from the Classic Theorists</em> is ideal for introductory courses in religion as well as courses in method and theory of religion, world religions, and sociology, psychology, or anthropology of religion.<br></p><p>Daniel L. Pals is a Professor of Religious Studies and History at the University of Miami.</p><h2>Narrative Methods for the Human Sciences</h2><p>The research literature on narrative has grown exponentially over the last 20 years. No longer the province only of literary study, the "narrative turn" has penetrated almost every human science: anthropology, sociology, psychology, history, and others. However, although insights about individual lives may be compelling, it does not mean that the "story" can "speak for itself" and still be a useful procedure. Is there a way that researchers can explain their analytic procedures or representational choices when they present a narrative study? <em>Narrative Methods for the Human Sciences</em> attempts to provide guidance on this situation. Aimed at providing the rigor needed to advance applied narrative analysis, Catherine Riessman provides an explanation and guideline to readers on: * Presentation of and reliance on detailed transcripts of interview excerpts * Methods for analyzing the structural features of discourse * Analysis of the co-production of narratives through the dialogic exchange between interviewer and participant.

In fact, five generations have passed, and Americans are still trying to measure the influence of the immense fratricidal conflict that nearly tore the nation apart. <br><br>In <em>The War that Forged a Nation</em>, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian James M. McPherson considers why the Civil War remains so deeply embedded in our national psyche and identity. The drama and tragedy of the war, from its scope and size--an estimated death toll of 750,000, far more than the rest of the country's wars combined--to the nearly mythical individuals involved--Abraham Lincoln, Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson--help explain why the Civil War remains a topic of interest. But the legacy of the war extends far beyond historical interest or scholarly attention. Here, McPherson draws upon his work over the past fifty years to illuminate the war's continuing resonance across many dimensions of American life. <br><br>Touching upon themes that include the war's causes and consequences; the naval war; slavery and its abolition; and Lincoln as commander in chief, McPherson ultimately proves the impossibility of understanding the issues of our own time unless we first understand their roots in the era of the Civil War. From racial inequality and conflict between the North and South to questions of state sovereignty or the role of government in social change--these issues, McPherson shows, are as salient and controversial today as they were in the 1860s. <br><br>Thoughtful, provocative, and authoritative, <em>The War that Forged a Nation</em> looks anew at the reasons America's civil war has remained a subject of intense interest for the past century and a half, and affirms the enduring relevance of the conflict for America today.<br></p><p><br><strong>James M. McPherson </strong>is an American Civil War historian, and is the George Henry Davis '86 Professor Emeritus of United States History at Princeton University. He is the author of many works of history, including <em>Battle Cry of Freedom</em>, which won the 1989 Pulitzer Prize.<br><br>"[O]ffers a welcome and much-needed challenge to the rigidity displayed by some accounts of that conflict. ... [C]ontains a wealth of oft-overlooked information and solid conclusions concerning many salient facets of the American Civil War. It is highly recommended." -- Joseph A. Rose, <em>The NYMAS</em> <em>Review</em><p></p><br>"Those readers unfamiliar with the history of the conflict can expect to learn much of the war's military, diplomatic, political, and social history, even as McPherson's sharp prose and narrative style keep the writing brisk." -- Cameron Givens, <em>Origins: Current Events in Historical Perspective</em><p></p><br>"McPherson's mastery of the Civil War literature and the field's historiographic debates allows him to present nuanced answers to those questions and many others, and his gift for narrative clarifies even the most obscure scholarly disputes." -<strong></strong><strong><em>Foreign Affairs</em></strong><strong></strong> <br><p></p><br>"Brisk and engrossing "The War That Forged a Nation" [McPherson] distills a lifetime of scrupulous scholarship into 12 essays--two new, the others extensively revised from previously published versions. Yet the book has none of the haphazard feel of an anthology, and readers will finish it with the sense that they have received a succinct history of the whole struggle, as well as numerous fresh and occasionally controversial observations." --<strong></strong><strong><em>Wall Street Journal</em></strong><strong></strong><p></p><br>Previous praise for Battle Cry of Freedom: <br> <br>"Deftly coordinated, gracefully composed, charitably argued and suspensefully paid out, McPherson's book is just the compass of the tumultuous middle years of the 19th century it was intended to be, and as narrative history it is surpassing. Bright with details and fresh quotations, solid with carefully-arrived-at conclusions, it must surely be, of the 50,000 books written on the Civil War, the finest compression of that national paroxysm ever fitted between two covers." --<strong>Los Angeles Times Book Review</strong><p></p><br>"The best one-volume treatment of [the Civil War era] I have ever come across. It may actually be the best ever published.... I was swept away, feeling as if I had never heard the saga before.... Omitting nothing important, whether military, political, or economic, he yet manages to make everything he touches drive the narrative forward. This is historical writing of the highest order." --<strong>Hugh Brogan, The New York Times Book Review</strong><p></p><br>"The finest single volume on the war and its background." --<strong>The Washington Post Book World</strong><p></p><br></p><h2>Stone by Design: The Artistry of Lew French</h2><p><p>More than 125 gorgeous photographs showcase the beauty of award-winning stonemason Lew French's work in eight different homes, illustrating how rounded fieldstone, gray slate, rough granite, and even curvy driftwood can be incorporated into stunning pieces of functional art. </p> <p>French provides charming narration for each project: how an idea came to be; how a stone-splitting technique is executed; even how one of his most difficult pieces, a three-year-long project, was saved from ruin the day it was completed. </p> <p>With its contemporary hearths of rustic slate, sculptured walls of both great granite slabs as well as stacked and rounded fieldstones, <i>Stone By Design: The Artistry of Lew French</i> will inspire design lovers to incorporate this material in home interiors and exteriors, whether as an artful writer's studio, a playful fireplace, or a carefully crafted garden pathway.</p> <p>More than just a stunning tribute to the work of Lew French and his unique vision and craft, this book celebrates both the function and form of stone.

For a long time he lay in the center of his bed, stared at the dark ceiling, and asked himself for the thousandth time if he had the courage. Finally, as the first trace of dawn peeked through a window, he accepted the solemn reality that it was time for the killing. The need for it had become so overwhelming that he could not continue with his daily routines. He could not remain the man he was until the deed was done. Its planning was simple, yet difficult to imagine. Its aftershocks would rattle on for decades and change the lives of those he loved and many of those he didn&#x2019;t. Its notoriety would create a legend, though he certainly wanted no fame. Indeed, as was his nature, he wished to avoid the attention, but that would not be possible. He had no choice. The truth had slowly been revealed, and once he had the full grasp of it, the killing became as inevitable as the sunrise. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He dressed slowly, as always, his war-wounded legs stiff and painful from the night, and made his way through the dark house to the kitchen, where he turned on a dim light and brewed his coffee. As it percolated, he stood ramrod straight beside the breakfast table, clasped his hands behind his head, and gently bent both knees. He grimaced as pain radiated from his hips to his ankles, but he held the squat for ten seconds. He relaxed, did it again and again, each time sinking lower. There were metal rods in his left leg and shrapnel in his right.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pete poured coffee, added milk and sugar, and walked outside&nbsp;onto the back porch, where he stood at the steps and looked across his land. The sun was breaking in the east and a yellowish light cast itself across the sea of white. The fields were thick and heavy with cotton that looked like fallen snow, and on any other day Pete would manage a smile at what would certainly be a bumper crop. But there would be no smiles on this day; only tears, and lots of them. To avoid the killing, though, would be an act of cowardice, a notion unknown to his being. He sipped his coffee and admired his land and was comforted by its security. Below the blanket of white was a layer of rich black topsoil that had been owned by Bannings for over a hundred years. Those in power would take him away and would probably execute him, but his land would endure forever and support his family. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mack, his bluetick hound, awoke from his slumber and joined him on the porch. Pete spoke to him and rubbed his head. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cotton was bursting in the bolls and straining to be picked, and before long teams of field hands would load into wagons for the ride to the far acres. As a boy, Pete rode in the wagon with the Negroes and pulled a cotton sack twelve hours a day. The Bannings were farmers and landowners, but they were workers, not gentrified planters with decadent lives made possible by the sweat of others.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He sipped his coffee and watched the fallen snow grow whiter as the sky brightened. In the distance, beyond the cattle barn and the chicken coop, he heard the voices of the Negroes as they were gathering at the tractor shed for another long day. They were men and women he had known his entire life, dirt-poor field hands whose ancestors had toiled the same land for a century. What would happen to them after the killing? Nothing, really. They had survived with little and knew nothing else. Tomorrow, they would gather in stunned silence at the same time in the same place, and whisper over the fire, then head to the fields, worried, no doubt, but also eager to pursue their labors and collect their wages. The harvest would go on, undisturbed and abundant.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He finished his coffee, placed the cup on a porch rail, and lit a cigarette. He thought of his children. Joel was a senior at Vanderbilt and Stella was in her second year at Hollins, and he was thankful they were away. He could almost feel their fear and shame at their father being in jail, but he was confident they would survive, like the field hands. They were intelligent and well-adjusted, and they would always have the land. They would finish their education, marry well, and prosper. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he smoked he picked up his coffee cup, returned to the kitchen, and stepped to the phone to call his sister, Florry. It was a Wednesday, the day they met for breakfast, and he confirmed that he would be there before long. He poured out the dregs, lit another cigarette, and took his barn jacket off a hook by the door. He and Mack walked across the backyard to a trail that led past the garden where Nineva and Amos grew an abundance of vegetables to feed the Bannings and their dependents. He passed the cattle barn and heard Amos talking to the cows as he prepared to milk them. Pete said good morning, and they discussed a certain fat hog that had been selected for a gutting come Saturday.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He walked on, with no limp, though his legs ached. At the tractor shed, the Negroes were gathered around a fire pit as they bantered and sipped coffee from tin cups. When they saw him they grew silent. Several offered &#x201c;Mornin&#x2019;, Mista Banning,&#x201d; and he spoke to them. The men wore old, dirty overalls; the women, long dresses and straw hats. No one wore shoes. The children and teenagers sat near a wagon, huddled under a blanket, sleepy-eyed and solemn-faced, dreading another long day picking cotton.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a school for Negroes on the Banning land, one made possible by the generosity of a rich Jew from Chicago, and Pete&#x2019;s father had put up enough in matching funds to see it built. The Bannings insisted that all the colored children on their land study at least through the eighth grade. But in October, when nothing mattered but the picking, the school was closed and the students were in the fields.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pete spoke quietly with Buford, his white foreman. They discussed the weather, the tonnage picked the day before, the price of cotton on the Memphis exchange. There were never enough pickers during peak season, and Buford was expecting a truckload of white workers from Tupelo. He had expected them the day before but they did not show. There was a rumor that a farmer two&nbsp;miles away was offering a nickel more per pound, but such talk was always rampant during the harvest. Picking crews worked hard one day, disappeared the next, and then came back as prices fluctuated. The Negroes, though, did not have the advantage of shopping around, and the Bannings were known to pay everyone the same. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The two John Deere tractors sputtered to life, and the field hands loaded into the wagons. Pete watched them rock and sway as&nbsp;they disappeared deep into the fallen snow. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He lit another cigarette and walked with Mack past the shed and along a dirt road. Florry lived a mile away on her section of land, and these days Pete always went there on foot. The exercise was painful, but the doctors had told him that long walks would eventually fortify his legs and the pain might one day subside. He doubted that, and had accepted the reality that his legs would burn and ache for the rest of his life, a life he was lucky to have. He had once been presumed dead, and had indeed come very close to the end, so every day was a gift.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until now. Today would be the last day of his life as he knew it, and he had accepted this. He had no choice.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Florry lived in a pink cottage she had built after their mother died and left them the land. She was a poet with no interest in farming but had a keen interest in the income it generated. Her section, 640 acres, was just as fertile as Pete&#x2019;s, and she leased it to him for half the profits. It was a handshake arrangement, one as ironclad as any thick contract, and grounded on implicit trust.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he arrived, she was in the backyard, walking through her aviary of chicken wire and netting, scattering feed as she chatted to her assortment of parrots, parakeets, and toucans. Beside the bird haven was a hutch where she kept a dozen chickens. Her two golden retrievers sat on the grass, watching the feeding with no interest in the exotic birds. Her house was filled with cats, creatures neither Pete nor the dogs cared for.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He pointed to a spot on the front porch and told Mack to rest there, then went inside. Marietta was busy in the kitchen and the house smelled of fried bacon and corn cakes. He said good morning to her and took a seat at the breakfast table. She poured him coffee and he began reading the Tupelo morning paper. From the old phonograph in the living room, a soprano wailed in operatic misery. He often wondered how many other folks in Ford County listened to opera. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Florry was finished with her birds, she came in the rear door, said good morning to her brother, and sat across from him. There were no hugs, no affection. To those who knew them, the Bannings were thought to be cold and distant, devoid of warmth and rarely emotional. This was true but not intentional; they had simply been raised that way.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Florry was forty-eight and had survived a brief and bad marriage as a young woman. She was one of the few divorced women in the county and thus looked down upon, as if somehow damaged and perhaps immoral. Not that she cared; she didn&#x2019;t. She had a few friends and seldom left her property. Behind her back she was often referred to as the Bird Lady, and not affectionately.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Marietta served them thick omelets with tomatoes and spinach, corn cakes bathed with butter, bacon, and strawberry jam. Except for the coffee, sugar, and salt, everything on the table came from their soil.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Florry said, &#x201c;I received a letter from Stella yesterday. She seems to be doing fine, though struggling with calculus. She prefers literature and history. She is so much like me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pete&#x2019;s children were expected to write at least one letter a week to their aunt, who wrote to them at least twice a week. Pete wasn&#x2019;t much for letters and had told them not to bother. However, writing to their aunt was a strict requirement.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t heard from Joel,&#x201d; she said.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;s busy,&#x201d; Pete said as he flipped a page of the news- paper. &#x201c;Is he still seeing that girl?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I suppose. He&#x2019;s much too young for romance, Pete, you should say something to him.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;He won&#x2019;t listen.&#x201d; Pete took a bite of his omelet. &#x201c;I just want him to hurry up and graduate. I&#x2019;m tired of paying tuition.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I suppose the picking is going well,&#x201d; she said. She had hardly touched her food. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Could be better, and the price dropped again yesterday. There&#x2019;s too much cotton this year.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;The price goes up and down, doesn&#x2019;t it? When the price is high there&#x2019;s not enough cotton and when it&#x2019;s low there&#x2019;s too much of it. Damned if you do, damned if you don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I suppose.&#x201d; He had toyed with the idea of warning his sister of what was to come, but she would react badly, beg him not to do it, become hysterical, and they would fight, something they had not done in years. The killing would change her life dramatically, and on the one hand he pitied her and felt an obligation to explain. But on the other, he knew that it could not be explained, and attempting to do so would serve no useful purpose.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The thought that this could be their last meal together was difficult to comprehend, but then most things that morning were being done for the last time.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were obliged to discuss the weather and this went on for a few minutes. According to the almanac, the next two weeks would be cool and dry, perfect for picking. Pete offered the same concerns about the lack of field hands, and she reminded him that this complaint was common every season. Indeed, last week over omelets he had lamented the shortage of temporary workers.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pete was not one to linger over food, especially on this awful day. He had been starved during the war and knew how little the body needed to survive. A thin frame kept weight off his legs. He chewed a bite of bacon, sipped his coffee, turned another page, and listened as Florry went on about a cousin who had just died at ninety, too soon in her opinion. Death was on his mind and he wondered what the Tupelo paper would say about him in the days to come. There would be stories, and perhaps a lot of them, but he had no desire to attract attention. It was inevitable, though, and he feared the sensational.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not eating much,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re looking a bit thin.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Not much of an appetite,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;How much are you smoking?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;As much as I want.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was forty-three, and, at least in her opinion, looked older.&nbsp;His thick dark hair was graying above his ears, and long wrinkles were forming across his forehead. The dashing young soldier who&#x2019;d gone off to war was aging too fast. His memories and burdens were heavy, but he kept them to himself. The horrors he had survived would never be discussed, not by him anyway. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once a month he forced himself to ask about her writing, her poetry. A few pieces had been published in obscure literary magazines in the last decade, but not much. In spite of her lack of success, she loved nothing more than to bore her brother, his children, and her small circle of friends with the latest developments in her career. She could prattle on forever about her &#x201c;projects,&#x201d; or about certain editors who loved her poetry but just couldn&#x2019;t seem to find room for it, or fan letters she had received from around the world. Her following was not that wide, and Pete suspected the lone letter from some lost soul in New Zealand three years earlier was still the only one that arrived with a foreign stamp.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He didn&#x2019;t read poetry, and after being forced to read his sister&#x2019;s he had sworn off the stuff forever. He preferred fiction, especially from southern writers, and especially William Faulkner, a man he&#x2019;d met before the war at a cocktail party in Oxford.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This morning was not the time to discuss it. He was facing an ugly chore, a monstrous deed, one that could not be avoided or postponed any longer.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He shoved his plate away, his food half-eaten, and finished his coffee. &#x201c;Always a pleasure,&#x201d; he said with a smile as he stood. He thanked Marietta, put on his barn coat, and left the cottage. Mack was waiting on the front steps. From the porch Florry called good-bye to him as he walked away and waved without turning around. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Back on the dirt road he lengthened his stride and shook off the stiffness caused by half an hour of sitting. The sun was up and burning off the dew, and all around the thick bolls sagged on the stems and begged to be picked. He walked on, a lonely ma...</p><h2>So Deadly, So Perverse: 50 Years of Italian Giallo Films</h2><p>Beginning with the release of Mario Bava's THE GIRL WHO KNEW TOO MUCH in 1963, Italian filmmakers developed and perfected their own peculiar brand of mystery-thriller known as the giallo. Named after the yellow (giallo in Italian) covers of the murder mysteries published by Mondadori, the giallo is awash in fetishistic imagery. For many fans, these films&#x2014;popularized in the works by writer-director Dario Argento, whose name is synonymous with the genre, thanks to such films as THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE and DEEP RED&#x2014;focus on stylized images of violent death: killers dressed in black stalking glamorous-looking victims through baroque architecture, literally painting the walls red with their blood. This is only one aspect of the giallo, however. With their groovy soundtracks by legendary composers like Ennio Morricone and Stelvio Cipriani and glamorous damsels-in-distress like Edwige Fenech, Rosalba Neri and Asia Argento, these films offer a heady mixture of sex, horror and suspense; at their best, they took excess to a hypnotic level. Troy Howarth, the author of THE HAUNTED WORLD OF MARIO BAVA and the co-author of the up-coming THE TOME OF TERROR series, examines the genre from its inception through its inevitable decline. Covering everything from popular fan favorites by the likes of Mario Bava, Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento to lesser-known gems by Cesare Canevari, Massimo Dallamano and Paolo Cavara as well as the worst of the worst by the least inspired of hacks, SO DEADLY, SO PERVERSE provides an in-depth examination of a genre that has too often been marginalized in other studies of the horror film and the thriller. In addition to reviews of every giallo made between 1963 and 2013, this two-part study of the giallo&#x2014;with volume two (covering 1974 onwards) coming later in the year&#x2014;is also lavishly illustrated with rare and colorful stills and poster art.</p><p></p><h2>On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead: Basic Concepts in the Kabbalah (Mysticism and Kabbalah)</h2><p>"A major contribution to our understanding of the Kabbalah." <br>--Arthur Green, Professor of Jewish Thought, Brandeis University<br><br>In the Zohar and other writings of the Kabbalah, Jewish mystics developed concepts and symbols to help them penetrate secrets of the cosmos that cannot be understood through reason or intellect. These ideas about God, human beings, and creation continue to fascinate and influence spiritual seekers of all persuasions today.<br><br>In clear and easy-to-understand prose, Gershom Scholem, the pioneer of the modern study of Jewish mysticism explains the basic concepts of the Kabbalah: the mystical "form of the imageless God"; good and evil; the <i>Tsaddik</i> or righteous soul; the <i>Shekhinah,</i> the feminine aspect of God; <i>gilgul,</i> the transmigration of souls; and <i>tselem,</i> the concept of the astral body. For anyone seeking to taste the mysteries of the Kabbalah, this is an essential book.</p><p><i>On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead: Basic Concepts of the Kabbalah</i> is Gershom Scholem's introduction to the essential terms of Jewish mysticism. His chapter on Shekhinah--the kabbalist symbol of the female element of the godhead--helps explain why Kabbalah has a growing following among women. His chapter on Gilgul, or reincarnation, is fascinating for its description of how a spiritual phenomenon is formed, following the process from revelation to writing to teaching. And his final chapter on Tselem, or the astral body, will make you think twice about laughing at Shirley MacLaine. The astral body, according to Kabbalah, is the spiritual nature of each human being--the image of God described in Genesis 1. Scholem quotes pages of medieval rabbis' fantastic discoveries of their astral bodies, such as the following: <blockquote>When I wished to find knowledge of the secrets of Creation, I came upon a dark vault within the depths of the earth, filled with blowing winds.... Then there appeared to me in my sleep a shape of most wondrous beauty [giving me instructions on how to conduct myself in order to attain knowledge of the highest things]. I then said to him: "Who are you?" And he answered: "I am your perfected nature."</blockquote> <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Gershom Scholem was a professor of Jewish mysticism at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem until his death in 1982. Among his most important works are <i>Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, The Messianic Idea in Judaism,</i> and <i>On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism.</i></p><h2>The Novel Art of Murder (Mystery Bookshop)</h2><p><i>Mystery bookstore owner Samantha Washington is trying to keep her grandmother from spending her golden years in an orange jumpsuit . . . </i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> The small town of North Harbor, Michigan, is just not big enough for the two of them: flamboyant phony Maria Romanov and feisty Nana Jo.

The silent glen stood draped in a pearl gray mist, the rugged peaks of Mulldonach mere shadows edged in copper, hinting at dawn.<br><br>A smile stole across her face. Her brothers were nowhere to be seen.<br><br>Davina swept her fingers over the cool, wet grass, then lightly patted her cheeks and brow, touching her nose for good measure. If the May dew banished her freckles, as the <b><i>auld </i></b>wives promised, she would gladly wash her face out of doors every morning of the year. Never mind that the ruddy spots matched her bright mane of hair; <b><i>ferntickles </i></b>were better suited to a child&#x2019;s complexion. After seventeen years, Davina was quite ready to be done with them. <br><br>She sat up and rearranged her drooping crown of daisies, meant to safeguard her from brownies, <b><i>bogles, </i></b>and other uncanny creatures that roamed the land on Beltane, then started to her feet when a familiar voice rose from the fog.<br><br>&#x201c;On May Day, in a fairy ring!&#x201d; Her brother William. There was no mistaking his baritone. His twin, Sandy&#x2013;only their mother called him Alexander&#x2013;would not be far behind.<br><b><i><br>Ah, well. </i></b>Davina spun round to greet them.<br><br>Two shaggy heads, black as midnight, emerged from the mist. A year younger than she, the twins were in every way identical, from their dark brown eyes to their broad chests and muscular backs. &#x201c;Like stags,&#x201d; their mother had once said, gently teasing them not to be seen on the moors during hunting season. <br><br>As the lads drew near, they finished the May Day rhyme. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve seen them round Saint Anthon&#x2019;s spring.&#x201d;<br><br>Davina recognized the poet. <br><br>&#x201c;Robert Ferguson,&#x201d; Will answered for her as if he&#x2019;d read the name in her eyes. He tugged at her unbound hair, which spilled down her back, the scarlet ends brushing her waist. &#x201c;Sandy, I told you we&#x2019;d spot a fairy on the <b><i>braes </i></b>this morning. See how her ears come to a point?&#x201d;<br><br>The McKie brothers never tired of comparing her to the wee folk since the crown of her head did not reach their shoulders, and her hands and feet were no bigger than a young girl&#x2019;s. She snatched her hair from Will&#x2019;s grasp, only to find his twin plucking at her skirts. <br><br>Sandy&#x2019;s eyes gleamed with mischief as he appraised her. &#x201c;A light green gown, fair skin, and a wreath of flowers. She only lacks wings.&#x201d; <br><br>Will winked at her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve not looked hard enough, Brother.&#x201d;<br><br>She fluttered her eyelet shawl behind her, making them both laugh. <br><br>&#x201c;I see by her wet cheek our fairy has been bathing in the dew.&#x201d; <br>Sandy gently tweaked her nose. &#x201c;Perhaps she thinks she&#x2019;s not bonny enough.&#x201d;<br><br>Davina knew he was teasing but turned on her heel nonetheless and flounced down the hill toward home, taking care not to lose her footing on the slippery grass and ruin her stageworthy exit. When her brothers called after her, she pretended not to hear them.<br><b><i><br>&#x201c;Och!&#x201d; </i></b>Will shouted her name, the sharpness of his voice muted by the moist air. &#x201c;Sandy meant no offense. You know how daft he is when it comes to the lasses.&#x201d;<br><br>She heard a soft groan as fist connected with flesh, then Sandy&#x2019;s voice, slightly winded. &#x201c;He speaks the truth, Davina. You&#x2019;ve no need of the May dew when you&#x2019;re already the fairest maid in Galloway.&#x201d;<br><br>An exaggerated claim. South West Scotland boasted dozens of young women far prettier than she. Still, she&#x2019;d made her brothers grovel long enough. Davina slowed her steps, letting the lads catch up.<br><br>&#x201c;There, now.&#x201d; Will wrapped her right hand round the crook of his elbow, and Sandy the same on her left. &#x201c;Let us cease any talk of your beauty. As it is, no gentleman in Monnigaff parish is worthy of you.&#x201d;<br><br>She could not clap her hands&#x2013;her usual means of expressing amusement&#x2013;so Davina simply shook her head at Will&#x2019;s foolishness as they continued downhill together. Perhaps that night when she took to the heath by the light of a gibbous moon, she&#x2019; d evade her brothers altogether. The ritual required absolute silence&#x2013;something she managed easily and the twins did not manage at all.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve a secret,&#x201d; Will confessed as the threesome reached level ground. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why we came looking for you.&#x201d; He led them away from the rushing waters of Buchan Burn and headed west toward the McKie mansion. &#x201c;Father intends to make an announcement after breakfast. As usual, he&#x2019;s told us nothing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye.&#x201d; Sandy grimaced. &#x201c;&#x2019;Twill be a revelation to us all.&#x201d;<br><br>Davina searched their faces in turn. Was it glad tidings or ill? She touched her lips, then her heart, knowing they would grasp her meaning: <b><i>Can you not tell me more? I will keep your secret. <br></i></b><br>Will shook his head, stamping the grass a bit harder. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all we know, lass. Father demanded we arrive promptly at table. He wasn&#x2019;t smiling when he said it.&#x201d;<br><b><i><br>Bad news, then.<br></i></b><br>Her earlier joy began to dissipate, like the morning mist giving way to the sun. The trio walked on in silence broken only by the throaty cry of a raven gliding above the surface of Loch Trool. When the thick stand of pines along the loch made continuing arm in arm impossible, Davina followed behind Will, with Sandy close on her heels, her mind turning over the possibilities.<br><br>Was a wedding in the offing? The twins were only sixteen, far too young for marriage. Davina&#x2019;s steps slowed. Surely her father did not have a suitor in mind for her? Not likely, or her mother would have mentioned something. Was Ian to marry, then? Quite as <b><i>braw </i></b>as their handsome father, her brother would make a fine catch for any lass. Nineteen years of age come October, he was man enough to take a wife. <br><br>Ian was in every way her older brother. Responsible. Trustworthy. Intelligent. The twins used other words: Predictable. Unimaginative. Dull. Davina suspected that envy fueled such sentiments: Ian would inherit all of Glentrool. Still, it was Will and Sandy who&#x2019;d come looking for her on the hills, speculating about an announcement. Might their father not have some favorable word to share with his younger sons? If so, she would mark this day as a rare and welcome occasion.<br><br>As they neared Glentrool, Davina lifted her gaze to its square central tower and the round turret nestled in the heart of its L-shaped design. Built of rough granite from the glen, the house was rugged and imposing, like the Fell of Eschoncan that stood behind it; immovable and unshakable, like the faith of the great-grandfather who had built it.<br><br>After crossing the threshold, they started down the long entrance hall, the twins&#x2019; boot heels loud against the hardwood floor. Davina paused at the mirror to smooth the muslin tucker round her neckline and pluck the flowers from her hair, now a tangled mess after her early morning ramble on the hills. <br><br>Drawing a steadying breath, she turned away from her reflection and walked into the dark-beamed dining room where she was greeted by portraits of McKies from generations past. A single window did little to brighten the dim interior. The rest of the family was already seated, with Father at the head of the long table, Ian to his left and Mother on his right. Though Ian simply said, &#x201c;Good morning,&#x201d; she saw the wariness in his gaze, heard his unspoken warning. <b><i>Something is amiss. </i></b>A slight furrow carved her father&#x2019;s brow. More cause for concern.<br><br>&#x201c;I was about to send Rab off to find you.&#x201d; Their mother&#x2019;s tone was kind, without censure. &#x201c;You see, my husband?&#x201d; She touched his sleeve.&nbsp; &#x201c;Your sons have joined you at table, just as you requested.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So they have.&#x201d; Jamie rested his hand on hers, a slight smile softening his features.<br><br>Most marriages among the gentry were forged in silver, with little thought for romance; not so her parents. Davina thought they made a handsome couple: Leana, with her porcelain skin, silvery blond hair, and wide, blue gray eyes; and Jamie, his brown hair still thick but shot through with silver, his dark brows arched over moss green eyes that missed nothing. Her mother had quietly celebrated her fortieth year in March and her father the same a few years earlier.<br><br>&#x201c;Dearest?&#x201d; Leana&#x2019;s voice stirred Davina from her reverie. So did the sketchbook that she slid toward her. &#x201c;I found this in your room and thought you might have need of it.&#x201d;<br><br>Davina opened the clothbound volume to a blank page, then fingered the attached charcoal pencil, carved to a fine point by her father&#x2019;s horn-handled knife. Whenever facial expressions or hand signals would not suffice to share her thoughts with others, she scribbled them along the margins of her sketches. Just now she felt a strong urge to draw something, to keep hand and mind occupied while the others ate, for she had little appetite.<br><br>Two servants entered from the kitchen, steaming dishes in hand. Rashers of bacon and a fragrant pot of cooked oats were added to the sideboard, joining a cold platter of sliced mutton and boiled hens&#x2019; eggs. The twins stood to fill their plates, more subdued than Davina had seen them in many a morning.<br><br>She swallowed a bit of dry oatcake, then quietly sipped her tea, searching her mother&#x2019;s face for some clue of what the morning might hold. Was that a slight tremor in Leana&#x2019;s chin? a hint of moisture in her eyes?<br><br>All at once her father thrust aside his half-eaten plate of food and dabbed his mouth, signaling his intentions. &#x201c;I have important news that cannot wait any longer.&#x201d;<br><br>Davina&#x2019;s breath caught. <b><i>Please, Father. Let it be good news. <br></i></b><br>Her brothers turned to the head of the table, their expressions grim, as Davina found her sketchbook pencil. It seemed their questions were about to be answered.</p><h2>I&#39;m With the Bears: Short Stories from a Damaged Planet</h2><p>The size and severity of the global climate crisis is such that even the most committed environmentalists can drift into a state of denial.

Pugin's interest in the Gothic style &#x2014; coming early during the Gothic Revival &#x2014; resulted in this influential and exquisitely drawn book of architectural ornaments, each item copied with rare precision and flair from the original decoration.<br>The 100 superb royalty-free plates in the present volume have been meticulously reproduced from a very rare early edition of plates dating from 1828&#x2013;31. Here is a wealth of floral, foliate, and other designs rendered from panels, capitals, borders, brackets, friezes, and other decorative elements adorning (primarily) ecclesiastical architecture. Included are finely detailed drawings of grotesques from the New College Chapel at Oxford, wooden choir-stall finials and elbow rests, wooden door ornaments and stone stringcourses from Rouen Cathedral, stone spandrels, and ornamental wooden and stone cusps from a number of English churches and chapels, stone paterae from Winchester Cathedral, and much more. Decorative samples from secular buildings include renderings of stone capitals from Kenilworth Castle, stone bosses from Eltham Palace in Kent, and brass figures from the tomb of Earl of Warwick.<br>Now regarded as one of the major sourcebooks of Gothic ornamentation, Pugin's illustrations will be welcomed by students of architectural history and design as an invaluable reference tool. Artists, illustrators, designers, and craftspeople will find these ready-to-use motifs an inspiring source of excellent designs for fabrics, wallpaper, tiles, and many other projects.<br>Reprint of <i>Gothic Ornaments Selected From Various Buildings in England and France</i>, Preistly &amp; Weale, London, 1828&#x2013;1831.</p></p><p></p><h2>Pierre: or, The Ambiguities (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>'Ambiguities indeed! One long brain-muddling, soul-bewildering ambiguity (to borrow Mr. Melville's style), like Melchisedeck, without beginning or end-a labyrinth without a clue - an Irish bog without so much as a Jack o'the'lantern to guide the wanderer's footsteps - the dream of a distempered stomach, disordered by a hasty supper on half-cooked pork chops." So judged the New York Herald when Pierre was first published in 1852, with most contemporary reviewers joining in the general condemnation: 'a dead failure,' 'this crazy rigmarole,' and "a literary mare's nest."

Only twelve when his father died bankrupt, young Herman tried work as a bank clerk, as a cabin-boy on a trip to Liverpool, and as an elementary schoolteacher, before shipping in January 1841 on the whaler Acushnet, bound for the Pacific. Deserting ship the following year in the Marquesas, he made his way to Tahiti and Honolulu, returning as ordinary seaman on the frigate United States to Boston, where he was discharged in October 1844. Books based on these adventures won him immediate success. By 1850 he was married, had acquired a farm near Pittsfield, Massachussetts (where he was the impetuous friend and neighbor of Nathaniel Hawthorne), and was hard at work on his masterpiece <b>Moby-Dick.</b><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Literary success soon faded; his complexity increasingly alienated readers. After a visit to the Holy Land in January 1857, he turned from writing prose fiction to poetry. In 1863, during the Civil War, he moved back to New York City, where from 1866-1885 he was a deputy inspector in the Custom House, and where, in 1891, he died. A draft of a final prose work, <b>Billy Budd, Sailor</b>, was left unfinished and uncollated, packed&nbsp;tidily away by his widow, where it remained until its rediscovery and publication in 1924.</p><p><b>William C. Spengemann</b> is the Hale Professor in Arts and Sciences and Professor of English Emeritus at Dartmouth College. He edited the Penguin Classics edition of <b>Nineteenth-Century American Poetry</b>.</p>This was Melville's 1852 follow-up to the then flop Moby Dick. His publishers, fearing they had another failure on their hands, forced Melville to make additions to the text before they'd publish it. Melville later referred to the original, shorter version as his "kraken" book. Editor Parker has here restored the psychological novel to Melville's intended form.

They spoke not French but regional dialects; much of the country had not been accurately mapped; and many in the rural areas lacked surnames. The author himself embarked on a 14,000-mile bicycle tour of the France passed over in tourist guides. The result is a curious, engrossing mix of personal observation, scholarly diligence and historical narrative as Robb discusses the formation of both the French character and the French state.

Schroeder explains why cutting-edge scientific theories point to a great plan underlying the universe.</p><p>The author of <i>The Hidden Face of God</i> and <i>Genesis and the Big Bang</i>, Gerald L. Schroeder is an applied theologian with undergraduate and doctoral degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His work has been reported in <i>Time, Newsweek, Scientific American</i>, and in leading newspapers around the world. He lives in Jerusalem with his wife and their five children.<b>Prologue: We Are the Universe Come Alive</b> <p> A single consciousness, an all-encompassing wisdom, pervades the universe. The discoveries of science, those that search the quantum nature of subatomic matter, those that explore the molecular complexity of biology, and those that probe the brain/mind interface, have moved us to the brink of a startling realization: all existence is the expression of this wisdom. In the laboratories we experience it as information first physically articulated as energy and then condensed into the form of matter. Every particle, every being, from atom to human, appears to have within it a level of information, of conscious wisdom. The puzzle I confront in this book is this: where does this arise? There is no hint of it in the laws of nature that govern the interactions among the basic particles that compose all matter. The information just appears as a given, with no causal agent evident, as if it were an intrinsic facet of nature. </p><p> The concept that there might be an attribute as nonphysical as information or wisdom at the heart of existence in no way denigrates the physical aspects of our lives. Denial of the pleasures and wonder of our bodies would be a sad misreading of the nature of existence. The accomplishments of a science based on materialism have given us physical comforts, invented lifesaving medicines, sent people to the moon. The oft-quoted statement, "not by bread alone does a human live" (Deut. 8:3), lets us know that there are <i>two</i> crucial aspects to our lives, one of which is bread, physical satisfaction. The other parameter is an underlying universal wisdom. There's no competition here between the spiritual and the material. The two are complementary, as in the root "to complete." </p><p> When we see through the camouflage haze that at times convinces us that only the material exists, when we touch that consciousness, we know it. A joyful rush of emotion sweeps over the entire self. This emotional response -- some might call it a religious experience -- is reported in every culture, from every period. It tells us that we've come home. We've discovered the essence of being. Everyone has felt it at some time or other. Perhaps at a brilliant sunrise, in a work of art, the words of a loved one. The physical and the metaphysical have joined. </p><p> If we dared, we'd call the experience spiritual, even Godly. But there's a reluctance to use the "G" word. "Listen to the Force" is acceptable on the great silver screen. If the <i>Star Wars</i> scriptwriter had used "Listen to God," the theater would have emptied in a flash. The reluctance is not surprising, considering the bizarre claims erroneously attributed to God through the ages and especially in our age. A bit of scrutiny reveals that most of those claims are based on the expectations for the putative (and generally misunderstood) God of the Bible that we learned as children. Obviously, when our child-learned wisdom is evaluated by the sophistication of our adult minds, that wisdom is bound to seem naive. </p><p> The age-old theological view of the universe is that all existence is the manifestation of a transcendent wisdom, with a universal consciousness being its manifestation. If I substitute the word information for wisdom, theology begins to sound like quantum physics. Science itself has rediscovered the confluence between the physical and the spiritual. </p><p> If a spiritual unity does underlie physical reality, it would be natural for people to search for that unity. Regrettably in the rush of our daily obligations we often become disconnected, losing the realization that such a unity might actually exist. Our private worlds today seem to expand almost as rapidly as the universe has been physically expanding since its creation. The scientific discoveries facilitating this nomadic mobility of the mind come at a rate that far exceeds the ability of our cultures to adapt. New technologies simply displace old cultural ties, and in doing so jettison traditions that formerly stabilized society. </p><p> In the developing world, those referred to as the poorest of the poor are the landless. In a sense we have become landless nomads, cut off from our roots, even in the midst of wealth. We deal in tokens. Other than artists and the one percent of the population that works on a farm, most of us have no relation to the final product of our labors. We buy and sell stocks of companies making products we barely understand. We deal in the ultimate of tokens, money. Money has no intrinsic value. It may promise security, pleasure, even freedom, but it doesn't provide those insatiable and all too often elusive goals. The resulting angst is almost palpable. Divorce rates exceed 50 percent. Violence in homes crosses socioeconomic divisions. Histories have been exchanged for gossamer hopes of a freedom untethered to tradition. </p><p> Accessing the consciousness within which we are embedded requires skills that go beyond our intuitions. The amazing, even startlingly illogical, discoveries in physics and biology during the past few decades have given us the tools to gain scientific insight into the metaphysical underpinnings of our world and, in return, acquire spiritual insight into scientific, empirical fact. Understanding nature's wonders need in no way detract from its majesty. By realizing the interwoven complexity of existence, we experience the oneness both by revelation and by reason. </p><p> No monk's life of isolated contemplation is being proposed here, no excluding of oneself from the world. The upsurge of interest in meditation, Eastern religions, and kabala reflects an almost desperate search to rediscover our spiritual roots. Those roots are best found while fulfilling the usual responsibilities of adult life, not within some cloister. Exposing the awe of existence <i>within</i> the reality of daily life is what this book is about. </p><p> We are, each of us, a part of the universe seeking itself. We struggle between a world that seems totally material and the emotional, even spiritual, pull we all feel at times. To relegate, a priori, those feelings of love and joy and spirituality to some assumed function of our ancestors' evolutionary drive for survival masks the greatest pleasure in life, the experiential realization of the metaphysical. </p><p> In the following pages, as we journey through the newly discovered marvels of the cosmos, of life, and finally of the brain/mind interface, I ask only that, as you read, you use these facts to reexamine your opinions concerning the origins, evolution, and essence of this wonderful world in which we live. </p><p> Copyright � 2001 by Gerald L.

Her numerous honors include the&nbsp;American&nbsp;Poetry Society's 2018 Wallace Stevens Award. she is the author of sixteen books, including&nbsp;<i>Like the Singing Coming off the Drums, Does Your House Have Lions?</i>,&nbsp;<i>Wounded in the House of a Friend</i>,&nbsp;<i>Shake Loose My Skin</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Morning Haiku.</i>Mapping out an education that starts with a "Homecoming"?"I have been a/ way so long/ once after college/ I returned tourist/ style to watch all/ the niggers killing/ themselves"?and arrives at a "Love Poem" that asks, "where are the fathers/ strutting their furlined/ intellect bowing their/ faces in the crotch/ of academia," Sanchez avoids many of the poetic pitfalls that an explicit political agenda can entail. This gathering, including work from six previous collections, highlights Sanchez's range: prose poems investigate disenfranchised lives, from a lover strung out on dope to a hate-crime victim whose home has been spray-painted with the predictably horrifying epithets, while lyrics move down the page in sinewy lines that seem to pluck living speech from air. But it is love, or the lack therof, that is at the heart of the book. Sanchez's language is restless in seeking it out, shuttling back and forth from a gritty black vernacular in "Towhomitmayconcern" ("git yo/ self fattened up man/ you gon be doing battle with me/ ima gonna stake you out") to the jazzy nomenclature of "This Is not a Small Voice" ("This is the voice of La Tanya./ Kadesha. Shaniqua. This/ is the voice of Antoine./ Darryl. Shaquille.") Such polyvocal lyrics celebrate the breadth of black culture, and probe the silences of bigotry. Like June Jordan, Sanchez is at her best when enacting power struggles rather than merely rallying political support in easy battlecries, as some of these poems do. This collection should draw wide attention to the consistency of Sanchez's achievement, and to the success of her formal adaptations, like the recent "Blues Haikus": "am I yo philly/ outpost? man when you sail in/ to my house, you docked." <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Be With</h2><p><p><strong><strong>WINNER OF THE 2019 PULITZER PRIZE IN POETRY<br> LONGLISTED FOR THE 2018 NATIONAL BOOK AWARD<br><em>Publishers Weekly</em>&nbsp;Best Poetry Book of 2018</strong><br><br> Forrest Gander&#x2019;s first book of poems since his Pulitzer finalist <em>Core Samples from the World</em>: a startling look through loss, grief, and regret into the exquisite nature of intimacy</strong></p> Drawing from his experience as a translator, Forrest Gander includes in the first, powerfully elegiac section a version of a poem by the Spanish mystical poet St. John of the Cross.

Representing a people whose very existence is in jeopardy, Davi Kopenawa paints an unforgettable picture of Yanomami culture, past and present, in the heart of the rainforest--a world where ancient indigenous knowledge and shamanic traditions cope with the global geopolitics of an insatiable natural resources extraction industry.</p><p>In richly evocative language, Kopenawa recounts his initiation and experience as a shaman, as well as his first encounters with outsiders: government officials, missionaries, road workers, cattle ranchers, and gold prospectors. He vividly describes the ensuing cultural repression, environmental devastation, and deaths resulting from epidemics and violence. To counter these threats, Davi Kopenawa became a global ambassador for his endangered people. <i>The Falling Sky</i> follows him from his native village in the Northern Amazon to Brazilian cities and finally on transatlantic flights bound for European and American capitals.

We are losing worlds upon worlds.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Louise Erdrich</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;What does it mean when someone says they can understand the inner lives of animals, trees, or even forests? Bruce Albert and Davi Kopenawa provide a vivid sense of this in <i>The Falling Sky: Words of a Yanomami Shaman</i>. The Yanomami of the Amazon, like all the indigenous peoples of the Americas and Australia, have experienced the end of what was once their world. Yet they have survived and somehow succeeded in making sense of a wounded existence. They have a lot to teach us.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Amitav Ghosh</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Guardian</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Falling Sky</i> is several things. It is the autobiography of Davi Kopenawa, one of Brazil&#x2019;s most prominent and eloquent indigenous leaders. It is the most vivid and authentic account of shamanistic philosophy I have ever read. It is also a passionate appeal for the rights of indigenous people and a scathing condemnation of the damage wrought by missionaries, gold miners, and white people&#x2019;s greed. The footnotes alone harbor monographs on Yanomami botany and zoology, mythology, ritual, and history. Most of all, <i>The Falling Sky</i> is an elegy to oral tradition and the power of the spoken word... Kopenawa&#x2019;s elaboration of shamanic concepts goes beyond ethnography and becomes a new genre of native philosophical inquiry. When an indigenous narrator this articulate produces an original exegesis of his own worldview, anthropology and anthropologists have become almost obsolete... Like his ancestors, whose voices will continue to echo in shamans&#x2019; songs after his death, Davi Kopenawa has made sure that his own powerful words will be preserved.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Glenn Shepard, Jr.</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Anthropologists and other specialists will find much to relish in this beautifully crafted evocation of Yanomami culture and philosophy. Based on hundreds of hours of interviews taped in native language, it is enriched by almost a hundred pages of footnotes, ethnobiological and geographic glossaries, bibliographical references, detailed indexes and, last but not least, an essay by Bruce Albert on how he wrote the book. While the book resonates with current Western metaphysical angst about finitude, it is written principally as a long shamanic chant that opens up a multitude of interior journeys and provides a new consciousness of the world as a whole... The Yanomami have suffered the effects of deadly epidemics, land dispossession and aggressive missionary evangelism. The resulting break in the flow of knowledge between older and younger generations, a lack of communication between indigenous and nonindigenous interlocutors, and a general loss of connection with the natural environment, are common problems. Despite remarkable political gains in the past thirty years, including the adoption of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 2007, a health and social crisis is deepening within many indigenous communities. As <i>The Falling Sky</i> makes plain, this crisis is rooted in the symbolic violence exercised by the dominant society, which fails to recognize the value (rather than just the right) of being different and of living in a distinct human collectivity... It is, above all, a splendid story told by an exceptional man, who barely knows how to read and write. That the story was written down by an ethnographer who elected not to adjust his research to the canons of academia adds to its importance. The use of the first-person singular to tell the tale involves a fusion of authorial voices, a sign of mutual recognition and true friendship if ever there was one; it lends a musical quality to the resulting &#x2018;heterobiography.&#x2019; Through their sonorous presence, the numerous beings evoked in the shamanic chant usher in the fertility of life as shamans see and feel it. What better way to entice readers away from everyday forgetfulness than to invite them to hear the forest&#x2019;s vast and timeless symphony?&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Laura Rival</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;One of the first and best autobiographical narratives by an indigenous lowland Amazonian...The book is a mix of autobiography, history, personal philosophy, and cultural criticism of whites for their destruction of the world, worship of the material, and lack of spirituality and vitality...The book is not only finely detailed and full of challenging philosophical points, it also contains much humor...Ultimately, it is Kopenawa&#x2019;s voice that tells us who he is, who his people are, and who we are to them. It is complex and nuanced; I&#x2019;d go so far as to call <i>The Falling Sky </i>a literary treasure: invaluable as academic reading, but also a must for anyone who wants to understand more of the diverse beauty and wonder of existence.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Daniel L. Everett</b><b>, </b><b><i>New Scientist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Kopenawa provides a fascinating glimpse into his life as well as into Yanomami cultural beliefs and practices, setting his story against the various threats the Yanomami people and their forest have faced since the 1960s...Kopenawa's story is eloquent, engaging, and thought-provoking, exuding heartfelt wisdom. This extraordinary and richly detailed work is an outstanding explication of the Yanomami worldview as well as a plea to all people to respect and preserve the rain forest.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Elizabeth Salt</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal (starred review)</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This engaging text, the autobiography of Yanomami shaman and activist Davi Kopenawa, translated with some prefatory remarks, appendixes, notes, and additional biographical comments by anthropologist Albert, offers a valuable insider perspective on a much-studied Amazonian society, with rich details on myth and religious practices, including shamanic initiation. Albert frames this story with a half-century-long history of exploitation by Westerners, ranging from anthropologists to government officials and developers. Kopenawa&#x2019;s direct experiences with, and assessment of, his white interlocutors is often charged with a well-justified anger, but through the course of his personal history the need for mutual respect and, where appropriate, collaboration is likewise made evident. The text offers a trenchant critique of the characterization of the Yanomami as humanity&#x2019;s primordial &#x2018;fierce people,&#x2019; highlighting the beauty and virtues of these people while reminding readers of Western cultural and ecological destruction in the Amazon (an exceptionally virulent brand of fierceness).&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>C. J.

But Joshua Summerhayes liked to run...with Yellow Dog trailing behind him." So it's no surprise when Joshua decides to enter a race from Melbourne to Sydney. People laugh when old Joshua shows up in his overalls and gumboots, calmly nibbling a slice of pumpkin for energy. But then he pulls into the lead, and folks are forced to sit up and take notice. Inspired by a true event (and just in time for fall's pumpkin harvest!) a talented team introduces a humble and generous hero who knows that winning isn't always the reason to run a race. Marsha Diane Arnold made "an impressive debut" (<i>School Library Journal</i>) with the multi-award-winning <i>Heart of a Tiger</i> (Dial). Brad Sneed most recently illustrated <i>Smoky Mountain Rose</i> (Dial), an American Bookseller Pick of the Lists that Publishers Weekly said will "make readers 'happy as a pig in a peanut patch.' " Marsha Diane Arnold lives in Sebastopol, California. Brad Sneed lives in Prairie Village, Kansas.</p><p>The first time I heard the true story on which The Pumpkin Runner is based, I was attending a workshop led by my friend, Jim Halm. To demonstrate perseverance, Jim told the story of Cliff Young, a 61-year-old farmer who had entered a 500 mile race from Melbourne to Sydney. He was the oldest of 11 runners. Amidst ridicule, Cliff won the race and took two days off the record, then he shared his winnings with all the other runners! I used this as the base for my story, but almost everything else is pure imagination. The race Cliff won was the inaugural (the very first!) Westfield Sydney to Melbourne Ultra Marathon. Unfortunately, from information I&#39;ve gleaned from the Internet, this race was only held from 1983 to 1991 and is no longer.I was born in Kansas, land of wheat fields and orange-purple sunsets.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first home I remember had no indoor bathroom! In winter, my younger brother and I took "baths" in the kitchen sink. In summer, we trekked to the "wash shed" beside our windmill. We sat in big, metal washing tubs as Mother poured warm water over our heads.</p><p>I was a timid child, but I had a special affinity for animals. Luckily, my father and his family were farmers. There were always plenty of animals around!</p><p>From first through sixth grade, I went to school in a two-room country school house. Later, I studied English at Kansas State University, but I never envisioned becoming a writer. As a child I loved to read, but I didn&#x2019;t really relate to the fact that there was someone writing the books I loved. Writers? Surely they were magical beings very different from me.</p><p>At Kansas State, I met Fred Arnold, a young basketball player. His coach was Tex Winter, now the assistant coach for the L.A. Lakers. Tex led Fred&#x2019;s team to the Big 8 Championship during Fred&#x2019;s senior year! My son, Calvin, plays basketball too. We are big basketball fans at our house! When Fred and I were married, we moved to Northern California. We have lived in the same house for 23 years, surrounded by rolling hills, wild turkey, quail, and deer.</p><p>When my children, Amy and Cal, were small, I began to write about their daily adventures. This led me to write "homegrown treasures", a syndicated column that won three Best Local Columnist awards from the California Newspaper Association. It made me happy to know that families read my column together and that both children and adults enjoyed it. I still believe that the very best writing is for all ages.</p><p>Writing a weekly column for ten years was a lot of work! But that experience taught me about writing and about discipline. Later, I wrote for children&#x2019;s magazines, but my dream was to someday write a real book like the ones I loved to read as a child. I realize now that my first book <b>Heart of a Tiger</b> was actually a roadmap for myself, as well as others. The story is about the small kitten, "Number Four", who has a big dream - to give himself a name like that of the Magnificent Bengal Tiger. The reader sees the process of having a dream, finding a mentor, and taking action to reach the dream.</p><p>I think it is in my book <b>The Bravest of Us All</b> that I come closest to writing about my childhood in Kansas. Although Kansas is not mentioned as the setting, fellow Kansans will recognize it. The story was originally inspired by my grandparents&#x2019; root cellar. There is mention of cow pastures, sandburs, tornadoes and other things Kansan.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been blessed in my writing career to have the very best editors and illustrators to work with. They play a big part in making my books the best they can be.</p><p>To find out more about my books and me, please visit my website, www.marshadianearnold.com.</p><p><b><i>*Book Awards Received*</i></b></p><p><b>Heart of a Tiger</b>&nbsp;<i>-</i> picture book, Dial Books for Young Readers 1995<b>* Ridgway Award -Best First Book<b>* IRA Children's Book Award - Distinguished Book<b>* Junior Library Guild Selection<b>* Houston Chronicle "Best Books of &#x2019;95 Roundup<b>* '98 Missouri Show Me Readers Award Winner<b>* '98 Washington Children's Choice Award Winner<b>* '97-98 Young Hoosier Book Award Winner<b>* SCBWI October 2001 "Book List for Children in Crises"</b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></p><p><b>The Pumpkin Runner</b>&nbsp;<i>-</i> picture book, Dial Books for Young Readers 1998<b>* Smithsonian's Notable Book 1998<b>*Outstanding Book Westchester Library Master List<b>*Missouri Show Me Readers Award Nominee 2000-2001<b>*Arkansas Diamond Primary Book Award Nominee 2000-2001</b></b></b></b></p><p><b>The Bravest of us All</b>&nbsp;<i>-</i> picture book, Dial Books for Young Readers 2000<b>*Atlanta Parent Monthly Best Books of 2000<b>*Bill Martin, Jr. Picture Book Award nominee, Kansas Reading Association, 2001<b>*Missouri Show Me Readers Award Nominee 2002-2003<b>*2001 Missouri Reading Circle (reading list sponsored by Missouri Reading Assoc.)</b></b></b></b></p><p><b><i>*Forthcoming Books*</i><b><b>Prancing, Dancing Lily</b>&nbsp;- Dial Books for Young Readers, March 2004<b><b>Roar of a Snore</b>&nbsp;- Dial Books for Young Readers</b></b></b></p></p><h2>No Telephone to Heaven</h2><p>A brilliant Jamaican-American writer takes on the themes of colonialism, race, myth, and political awakening through the experiences of a light-skinned woman named Clare Savage. The story is one of discovery as Clare moves through a variety of settings &#x2013; Jamaica, England, America &#x2013; and encounters people who affect her search for place and self.<p>The structure of <b>No Telephone to Heaven</b> combines naturalism and lyricism, and traverses space and time, dream and reality, myth and history, reflecting the fragmentation of the protagonist, who nonetheless seeks wholeness and connection. In this deply poetic novel there exist several levels: the world Clare encounters, and a world of which she only gradually becomes aware &#x2013; a world of extreme poverty, the real Jamaica, not the Jamaica of the middle class, not the Jamaica of the tourist. And Jamaica &#x2013; almost a character in the book &#x2013; is described in terms of extraordinary beauty, coexisting with deep human tragedy.</p><p>The violence that rises out of extreme oppression, the divided loyalties of a colonized person, sexual dividedness, and the dividedness of a person neither white nor black &#x2013; all of these are truths that Clare must face. Overarching all the themes in this exceptionally fine novel is the need to become whole, and the decisions and the courage demanded to achieve that wholeness.</p><p></p></p><p><b>Michelle Cliff</b> was born in Jamaica and is the author of three acclaimed novels: <b>Abeng</b>, its sequel, <b>No Telephone to Heaven</b>, and <b>Free Enterprise</b> (Plume).

After all, the owner of the mystery bookstore, Haven't Got a Clue, has been spending more time solving whodunits than reading them...</i><br><br>Tricia's sister, Angelica, considers herself to be the next celebrity chef. To celebrate her first cookbook, Angelica hosts a launch party, but sadly the only guest is an oversized cutout of herself. Worse than the lack of fans is a nearby gas explosion that injures her boyfriend, Bob Kelly, the head of the Chamber of Commerce.<br><br>Tricia's never been a fan of Bob, but when she reads that Bob is being tight-lipped about the "accident" and how it killed the owner of the town's history bookstore, it's time to take action. As the incriminating details emerge, Tricia gets wrapped up in a murder that proves to be as spine-tingling as the books that line her shelves...</p><p>The immensely popular Booktown Mystery series is what put Lorna Barrett's name on the New York Times Bestseller list, but it's her talent&nbsp;--&nbsp;whether writing as Lorna, or L.L. Bartlett, or Lorraine Bartlett -- that keeps her there. This multi-published, Agatha-nominated author pens the exciting Jeff Resnick Mysteries as well as the acclaimed Victoria Square and Lotus Bay Mystery series, as well as the Tales of Telenia adventure-fantasy series, and has many short stories and novellas to her name(s).<b>one</b><p>The poster on the Cookery&#x2019;s display window had advertised the book signing for at least a month. Throngs of people were supposed to be in evidence. A temporary cook station had been assembled, and ramekins filled with diced vegetables, chopped chicken, and spices were lined up like props in a stage play.</p><p>Tricia Miles forced a smile and tried not to glance at her watch. &#x201c;Everything looks perfect,&#x201d; she said with a cheerfulness in her voice she didn&#x2019;t quite feel.</p><p>The &#x201c;guest&#x201d; author, her sister Angelica, stood behind the cook station, head held high, although her eyes were watery and her mouth trembled ever so slightly. Next to her stood a larger-than-life-size photo cutout of . . . herself! The real Angelica was maybe five foot six in her stocking feet&#x2014;the cutout was six feet tall, dressed in dark slacks and a white blouse covered by a buff-colored, full-front apron with her,name emblazoned across the front: ANGELICA MILES, and beneath that: author of EASY-DOES-IT COOKING.</p><p>Tricia tried to concentrate on the living Angelica, but her gaze kept wandering to the cutout. It wasn&#x2019;t a good likeness, but somehow Angelica had missed that when she&#x2019;d purchased the thing as an aid for promotion. Her rather demented expression was one of perpetual surprise&#x2014;either that, or one of a victim of bad plastic surgery. With her fingers splayed, the cutout reminded Tricia of a bird spreading its bony wings. Yes, that was it&#x2014;Angelica looked like she&#x2019;d been goosed. Either that, or the photographer had coached her into an uncanny imitation of a constipated blue heron.</p><p>The real Angelica spoke, her voice sounding wobbly. &#x201c;Nobody&#x2019;s going to come. Not one person.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here,&#x201d; said a smiling Ginny Wilson, Tricia&#x2019;s twenty-something assistant at her mystery bookstore, Haven&#x2019;t Got a Clue.</p><p>&#x201c;And I,&#x201d; said elderly Mr. Everett, Tricia&#x2019;s other part-time employee.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget me,&#x201d; Frannie May Armstrong said in her Texas twang. Angelica owned the Cookery, Stoneham&#x2019;s cookbook store, and Frannie managed it for her. Angelica also owned Booked for Lunch, a retro caf� across the street. Writing cookbooks was just another entry on her colorful r�sum�.</p><p>Unfortunately, the village of Stoneham, known locally as &#x201c;Booktown,&#x201d; was more a tourist destination not far from the New Hampshire/Massachusetts state line. Not many of the locals supported the booksellers, who&#x2019;d been recruited to save what had been a dying village. And shops filled with used, rare, and antiquarian books had done it, too, as evidenced by new prosperity and a much-needed influx of tax revenue.</p><p>&#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t a busload of gourmands supposed to arrive for the signing?&#x201d; Mr. Everett whispered to Frannie.</p><p>&#x201c;I got a call about an hour ago,&#x201d; she whispered in reply. &#x201c;They canceled, but asked for a rain check. They may come up sometime in the fall.&#x201d;</p><p>Tricia refrained from commenting. Thanks to the Internet, Angelica had cultivated a relationship with the &#x201c;Gamboling Gourmets,&#x201d; who traveled New England throughout the summer, tasting the local cuisines. Tonight&#x2019;s signing was to be their first outing of the year, and Angelica&#x2019;s launch party. She&#x2019;d spent days preparing a table full of desserts&#x2014;all from her newly published book, Easy-Does-It Cooking, which had been officially available all of two days.</p><p>Angelica&#x2019;s cutout notwithstanding, Tricia had expected at least a few more warm bodies to attend the signing. Mr. Everett&#x2019;s bride of eight months had come down with a cold, which explained her absence, but surely the employees at Angelica&#x2019;s caf�&#x2014;Jake Masters, the cook, and Darcy Gebhard, the waitress&#x2014;might have made an effort to be there. And someone else was conspicuous by his absence.</p><p>&#x201c;Anybody know where Bob is?&#x201d; Frannie asked.</p><p>Bob Kelly, owner of Kelly Real Estate and the president of the local Chamber of Commerce, had been Angelica&#x2019;s significant other for the past eighteen months&#x2014;ever since she&#x2019;d come to live in Stoneham.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;ll have a perfectly reasonable explanation for being late,&#x201d; Tricia lied. She and Bob weren&#x2019;t exactly best friends, but she tried to overlook his many shortcomings for her sister&#x2019;s sake.</p><p>&#x201c;I saw his car parked down the street, near History Repeats Itself,&#x201d; Ginny volunteered. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been there awhile.&#x201d;</p>Angelica pouted. &#x201c;He said he&#x2019;d be here.&#x201d;<p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s still time,&#x201d; Tricia reassured her.</p><p>Angelica nodded, resigned, and tucked a lock of her short, blonde hair behind her left ear. &#x201c;Business hasn&#x2019;t been good lately, and he&#x2019;s been preoccupied. It probably just slipped his mind.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; Tricia said, and hoped her nose hadn&#x2019;t just grown an inch. For weeks, Angelica had done nothing but talk about the event.</p><p>Frannie straightened the stack of unsigned books on the side table, and everyone tried not to make eye contact with Angelica as they waited in awkward silence for someone&#x2014;anyone&#x2014;else to arrive. Finally, Ginny suggested Angelica go ahead with her cooking demonstration.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the point?&#x201d; Angelica asked, defeat coloring her voice.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s almost seven thirty, and none of us has had dinner. I can&#x2019;t be the only one eager to try your Hacienda Tacos.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good old Tex-Mex&#x2014;the best food on Earth,&#x201d; Frannie piped up, then sighed. &#x201c;Next to a luau, that is.&#x201d; It was Frannie&#x2019;s dream to retire to the fiftieth state.</p><p>Angelica gave a careless shrug and turned on the electric skillet.</p><p>Across the street, the newly installed gas lamps glowed. The Board of Selectmen had approved the installation of the old-fashioned streetlights in an effort to capitalize on the town&#x2019;s history and its new lease on life. Tourists ate up that kind of stuff, and the Board of Selectmen was eager to do all it could to encourage their visits. Unfortunately, when the bookstores closed, the visitors disappeared, leaving no one to appreciate them.</p><p>Within minutes, Angelica had prepared the filling, spooned it into corn tortillas, and passed them out to her small&#x2014;and hungry&#x2014;audience. The desserts were then sampled, and everyone sipped complimentary coffee, not making a dent in the contents of the five-gallon urn borrowed from Angelica&#x2019;s caf�.</p><p>As Angelica served Mr. Everett another portion of coconut cake, Tricia gave Ginny a nudge. &#x201c;Buy a book,&#x201d; she whispered.</p><p>Ginny&#x2019;s eyes nearly popped. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re thirty-four dollars,&#x201d; she hissed. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t afford it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Use your charge card, and I&#x2019;ll credit your account tomorrow morning. I want Ange to make at least a couple of sales tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>Ginny shrugged. &#x201c;If you insist.&#x201d; She set down her paper cup, grabbed a copy of the coffee-table-sized book filled with glossy photos, and marched up to the cash desk where Angelica stood wringing her hands. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know about the rest of you, but I&#x2019;m proud to be the first to get my signed copy of Easy-Does-It Cooking.&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Everett&#x2019;s nervous gaze shifted to Tricia. She mouthed the words Buy one&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll pay you back.</p><p>&#x201c;Uh, uh&#x2014;let me be the second,&#x201d; Mr. Everett said.</p><p>Luckily, Angelica hadn&#x2019;t noticed Tricia&#x2019;s prompting. She pressed a clenched hand to her lips, fighting back tears. &#x201c;You guys are just the best. Frannie, grab the camera, will you?&#x201d; she said. Next, she played director, carefully positioning Ginny with her back to the camera, posed to her satisfaction. She shook Ginny&#x2019;s hand. She raised a finger to make a point. She looked surprised&#x2014;then serious, and, ultimately, very silly. At last, Angelica reached for her pen, wrote a few words on the flyleaf of Ginny&#x2019;s copy, and signed her name with such a flourish that it was completely illegible. Frannie kept snapping pictures as Angelica handed the book to Ginny.</p><p>Ginny frowned. &#x201c;Live free or diet?&#x201d; Was Angelica mocking the state motto?</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, don&#x2019;t you think that&#x2019;s clever?&#x201d; Angelica said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to sign that in all the books.&#x201d;</p><p>Though Ginny forced a smile, her voice was flat. &#x201c;Go for it.&#x201d;</p><p>As Mr. Everett stepped up to have his book signed, Tricia moved to look out the large display window that faced Main Street. As Ginny had said, Bob&#x2019;s car was parked near History Repeats Itself. Tricia&#x2019;s anger smoldered. How inconsiderate of Bob to ignore Angelica&#x2019;s very first signing. He had to know how much it meant to her.</p><p>Tricia glanced back at her sister and Mr. Everett, still posing for Frannie. In a fit of pique, she decided it was time for action. She&#x2019;d go find Bob and, if necessary, drag him back to the Cookery by this thinning hair. Besides, Angelica&#x2019;s photographic self was beginning to creep her out.</p><p>Tricia took a Zen moment to calm herself before she spoke. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ll run out and see if I can find Bob,&#x201d; she told Angelica. &#x201c;If his car is parked down the road, he can&#x2019;t be very far away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose,&#x201d; Angelica said. &#x201c;But please hurry back to help us pack up some of these desserts.&#x201d; She shook her head, taking in the amount of leftover food. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t serve all this at the caf�. Would you like to take some home, Ginny?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Would I? Hand me the plastic wrap, will you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Be right back,&#x201d; Tricia called and headed out the door.</p><p>The village was practically deserted, and Bob&#x2019;s car was the only vehicle parked on the west side of Main Street. Tricia crossed the street and started down the sidewalk. Upon consideration, she decided she wouldn&#x2019;t berate Bob, at least not in front of Jim Roth, owner of History Repeats Itself. It wouldn&#x2019;t do to go ballistic with him as an audience. Instead, her plan was to poke her head inside the door and cheerfully ask if Bob hadn&#x2019;t forgotten another engagement&#x2014;and probably do it through gritted teeth.</p><p>The glowing gas lamps really did lend a quaint, old-fashioned charm to the already picturesque storefronts. Although an expensive indulgence, they added to the village&#x2019;s ambience&#x2014;especially outside of Haven&#x2019;t Got a Clue. It went right along with the atmosphere she&#x2019;d created, emulating 221B Baker Street in London.</p><p>Tricia was within two doors of History Repeats Itself when she paused to look inside Booked for Lunch. Angelica had done a wonderful job decorating the caf�. Heck, she&#x2019;d done a terrific job managing two businesses and starting a writing career. Not that Tricia had ever mentioned to Angelica how proud she was of Angelica&#x2019;s accomplishments. As it was, her swelled head could barely fit through a standard doorway.</p><p>As Tricia took a step forward, she heard a phoomph. The Earth shook as a shower of glass exploded onto the street, and a rush of hot air enveloped her, the shock of it knocking her to the ground.</p><p>Then everything went black.</p></p><h2>Heaven&#39;s Breath: A Natural History of the Wind (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>Wind is everywhere and nowhere.

Butler, and Stephen King - <i>Wastelands</i> explores the scientific, psychological, and philosophical questions of what it means to remain human in the wake of Armageddon. <br><br> Whether the end of the world comes through nuclear war, ecological disaster, or cosmological cataclysm, these are tales of survivors, in some cases struggling to rebuild the society that was, in others, merely surviving, scrounging for food in depopulated ruins and defending themselves against monsters, mutants, and marauders. <i>Wastelands</i> delves into this bleak landscape, uncovering the raw human emotion and heart-pounding thrills at the genre's core.</p><p>John Joseph Adams, called "the reigning king of the anthology world" by Barnes &amp; Noble, is the bestselling editor of many anthologies, such as EPIC, OTHER WORLDS THAN THESE, ARMORED, UNDER THE MOONS OF MARS: NEW ADVENTURES ON BARSOOM, LIGHTSPEED: YEAR ONE, BRAVE NEW WORLDS, WASTELANDS, THE LIVING DEAD, THE LIVING DEAD 2, BY BLOOD WE LIVE, FEDERATIONS, THE IMPROBABLE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, and THE WAY OF THE WIZARD.

Also featuring Orson Scott Card, Octavia E. Butler, and Gene Wolfe, and including an original story by Jerry Oltion ('Judgment Passed'), this title belongs in most sf or short fiction collections. --Library Journal<br><br>Wastelands is an exceptional anthology. In scope and vision it can only be compared to Harlan Ellison-s Dangerous Visions. Like that famed anthology, Wastelands collects some of the best stories of a genre, each with an introduction by the editor that sets the stage for the events that unfold. The stories are full of depth, but are also so well crafted that they are not preachy. None of the stories will disappoint the reader who picks up this anthology. ...<br><br>I highly recommend this anthology for anyone who enjoys reading anything. A lot of these authors I had not read before and I now want to seek out their novels at the bookstore. Each story is unique, and while all share the same basic frame, each writer has been able to pull a completely different conclusion about or assessment of humanity. Some are chilling while others are hopeful, but each will show the reader a facet of himself or herself if they are willing to see it. Wastelands: Stories of the Apocalypse is the best anthology of any kind I have read to date. --Grasping for the Wind</p><h2>The NIV Application Commentary : Daniel</h2><p>Most Bible commentaries take us on a one-way trip from the twentieth century to the first century. But they leave us there, assuming that we can somehow make the return journey on our own.

After the police failed to turn up any leads, a friend suggested she call a dowser&#x2014;a man who specialized in finding lost objects. With nothing to lose&#x2014;and almost as a joke&#x2014;Dr. Mayer agreed. Within two days, and without leaving his Arkansas home, the dowser located the exact California street coordinates where the harp was found.<br><br>Deeply shaken, yet driven to understand what had happened, Mayer began the fourteen-year journey of discovery that she recounts in this mind-opening, brilliantly readable book.

But it came back in a way that irrevocably changed my familiar world of science and rational thinking. It changed the way I go about living in that world. It changed the way I perceive the world and try to make sense out of it.<br><br>This book is about what unfolded as I attempted to explain what happened. I encountered questions: huge and disconcerting questions about the world as we know it. They held radical import not just for science but for the ways we live our everyday lives. This is a book about those questions and some of the surprising answers I encountered along the way.<br><br>In 1991 I was teaching in the psychology department of the University of California at Berkeley and at the University Medical Center in San Francisco. I was doing research on female development and seeing patients in my psychoanalysis practice. I was a member of numerous professional associations, doing committee work, attending international meetings, functioning on editorial boards, and lecturing all over the country. I was a training and supervising analyst in the American Psychoanalytic Association. I was busy and fulfilled, and life was running along the way it does.<br><br>My eleven-year-old daughter, Meg, who'd fallen in love with the harp at age six, had begun performing. She wasn't playing a classical pedal harp but a smaller, extremely valuable instrument built and carved by a master harp maker. After a Christmas concert, her harp was stolen from the theater where she was playing. For two months we went through every conceivable channel trying to locate it: the police, instrument dealers across the country, the American Harp Society newsletters&#x2014;even a CBS TV news story. Nothing worked.<br><br>Finally, a wise and devoted friend told me, "If you really want that harp back, you should be willing to try anything. Try calling a dowser." The only thing I knew about dowsers were that they were that strange breed who locate underground water with forked sticks. But according to my friend, the "really good" dowsers can locate not just water but lost objects as well.<br><br>Finding lost objects with <i>forked sticks?</i> Well, nothing was happening on the police front, and my daughter, spoiled by several years of playing an extraordinary instrument, had found the series of commercial harps we'd rented simply unplayable. So, half-embarrassed but desperate, I decided to take my friend's dare. I asked her if she could locate a really good dowser&#x2014;the best, I said. She promptly called the American&nbsp;Society of Dowsers and came back with the phone number of the society's current president: Harold McCoy, in Fayetteville, Arkansas.<br><br>I called him that day. Harold picked up the phone&#x2014;friendly, cheerful, heavy Arkansas accent. I told him I'd heard he could dowse for lost objects and that I'd had a valuable harp stolen in Oakland, California. Could he help locate it?<br><br>"Give me a second," he said. "I'll tell you if it's still in Oakland." He paused, then: "Well, it's still there. Send me a street map of Oakland and I'll locate that harp for you." Skeptical&#x2014;but what, after all, did I have to lose?&#x2014;I promptly overnighted him a map. Two days later, he called back. "Well, I got that harp located," he said. "It's in the second house on the right on D&#x2014; Street, just off L&#x2014; Avenue."<br><br>I'd never heard of either street. But I did like the sound of the man's voice&#x2014;whoever he was. And I don't like backing down on a dare. Why not drive to the house he'd identified? At least I'd get the address. I looked on an Oakland map and found the neighborhood. It was miles from anywhere I'd ever been. I got in my car, drove into Oakland, located the house, wrote down the number, called the police, and told them I'd gotten a tip that the harp might be at that house. Not good enough for a search warrant, they said. They were going to close the case&#x2014;there was no way this unique, portable, and highly marketable item hadn't already been sold; it was gone forever.<br><br>But I found I couldn't quite let it go. Was it the dare? Was it my admiration for the friend who'd instigated the whole thing? Was it my devastated daughter? Or was it just that I had genuinely liked the sound of that voice on the other end of the line?<br><br>I decided to post flyers in a two-block area around the house, offering a reward for the harp's return. It was a crazy idea, but why not? I put up flyers in those two blocks, and only those two blocks. I was embarrassed enough about what I was doing to tell just a couple of close friends about it.<br><br>Three days later, my phone rang. A man's voice told me he'd seen a flyer outside his house describing a stolen harp. He said it was exactly the harp his next-door neighbor had recently obtained and showed him. He wouldn't give me his name or number, but offered to get the harp returned to me. And two weeks later, after a series of circuitous telephone calls, he told me to meet a teenage boy at 10:00 p.m., in the rear parking lot of an all-night Safeway. I arrived to find a young man loitering in the lot. He looked at me, and said, "The harp?" I nodded. Within minutes, the harp was in the back of my station wagon and I drove off.<br><br>Twenty-five minutes later, as I turned into my driveway, I had the thought, <i>This changes everything.</i><br><br>I was right. The harp changed how I work as a clinician and psychoanalyst. It changed the nature of the research I pursued. It changed my sense of what's ordinary and what's extraordinary. Most of all, it changed my relatively established, relatively contented, relatively secure sense of how the world adds up. If Harold McCoy did what he appeared to have done, I had to face the fact that my notions of space, time, reality, and the nature of the human mind were stunningly inadequate. Disturbing as that recognition was, there was something intriguing, even exciting, about it as well.<br><br>Over the ensuing months I spent a lot of sleepless nights. I argued with myself a lot. I regularly woke up at 3:00 a.m. certain that with just a little more effort, a little more clear thinking, I'd come up with some comfortably rational way to explain how that harp had ended up back in my living room where it belonged. Finally a friend of mine, a statistics professor at Berkeley, listened to my conflicted ranting and said in exasperation, "Get over it and get some sleep, Lisby. As a statistician, I can promise you the odds that dowsing works are a lot greater than the odds that this could have been coincidence."<br><br>I decided it was time to consider what it might mean if I started taking the whole thing seriously. <i>What if</i>, I began wondering. <i>What if</i> I stopped trying to explain it all away but instead tried to consider how on earth a dowser, over the phone and from two thousand miles away, could pinpoint the exact location of my stolen harp within the vast metropolitan San Francisco Bay Area?<br><br>I began to look into the scientific evidence for dowsing. That quickly led to reports from some very respectable scientific minds about all kinds of other, possibly related anomalous phenomena. I was discovering a vast, strange new territory of research regarding anomalous mind-matter interactions&#x2014;interactions between mind and matter that simply cannot be contained inside what we call normal science.<br><br>Of course, I also discovered that the world of anomalous mind-matter interactions is filled with shoddy research, flaky research, and research based on questions that are neither particularly interesting nor rooted in a solid grasp of science, scientific method, or scientific thinking. Yet as I delved more deeply, what most impressed me was the significant bank of well-conducted, scientifically impeccable research that imposes enormous questions on anyone interested in making sense of the world from a Western scientific point of view. I began to wonder, why had so much of this excellent research been overlooked, its conclusions dismissed?<br><br>Weeks after I'd published my first tentative foray into exploring mind-matter anomalies, a physician I barely knew came up to me at a professional meeting. He'd read my article and wanted to tell me something. The story poured out. He'd been diagnosed twenty years earlier with fatal bone cancer and had become deeply depressed. As a marathon runner, he'd found relief from despair only while he ran. Early one morning, two hours into his run, he'd been suddenly overcome by what he described as "a sensation of light&#x2014;clear, soft light, as though light was filling my bones, as though light and air were infusing each bone. I saw it&#x2014;light penetrating those bones, right through to the marrow."<br><br>The next week his X-rays were clean. "I've never told another colleague," he said. "I told my wife when it happened&#x2014;no one else. And this part I didn't tell anyone: I know that's what cured me. The light crowded out the cancer cells. I don't know how, but I know it did."<br><br>As word of my new interest spread, my medical and psychoanalytic colleagues began to inundate me with accounts of their own anomalous experiences, personal as well as clinical. As with the physician, the stories they shared with me were often ones they'd never revealed to another professional associate. Their accounts&#x2014;by e-mail, snail mail, at conferences, in seminars, in hall corridors or at dinner&#x2014;made as little sense to me as they did to the colleagues telling me about them. The stories were all about knowing things in bizarrely inexplicable ways:<br><br>"My patient walked in and I knew her mother had died&#x2014;no clues&#x2014;I just knew, instantly."<br><br>"I woke up in the middle of the night like I heard a shot; the next day I found out it was exactly when my patient took a gun and tried to kill herself."<br><br>"I suddenly felt that my partner's son was in trouble. I called my partner; it worried him enough that he tracked down his son. His son had been in a bad car accident and my partner got there just in time to make a decision about surgery that probably saved his life."<br><br>I was particularly fascinated by how eagerly my colleagues shared even the most weirdly personal stories with me. Their eagerness puzzled me, until I realized how badly people wanted to reintegrate corners of experience they'd walled off from their public lives for fear of being disbelieved.<br><br>"I was on a bus and all of a sudden found myself smelling the perfume my brother's ex-wife used to wear. When the bus stopped, she got on. I hadn't smelled that perfume or seen her in thirty years."<br><br>"My husband and I fell in love with a house in London on our honeymoon&#x2014;very distinctive, across from a park. Fourteen years later, living in Boston, I woke up one day, and thought, maybe we could buy it. I tracked down a realtor in London, asked if she could figure out the address and find out if it was for sale. Crazy! But she did. The man who'd been living there had just died; the For Sale sign wasn't even up yet. We bought it the next week."<br><br>I began taking notes, word for word and with every detail I could catch. I couldn't figure out what else to do. I couldn't ignore the things people were telling me, but I couldn't find ways to make sense of them either. The stories were from credible people, backed up by enough hard facts that I couldn't reject them out of hand.<br><br>As my files of all these notes grew, I found myself pursuing the odd, unexpected conversation with a new kind of curiosity, not just with colleagues but also with friends, students, and even first-time acquaintances. I began asking different questions. Someone would mention an unusual outcome of a friend's illness; instead of letting it pass, I'd ask what was so unusual. In return, I'd often hear accounts of apparently anomalous healing or treatment or even diagnoses: perhaps a stranger delivering an accurate, complex diagnosis of a medical condition over the phone, without any background information. Or someone would describe knowing something but having no idea how they knew it, and I'd probe gently. Peculiar stories would follow: a woman wakened by a sudden ache in her chest just as her father suffered a heart attack three thousand miles away; a man assaulted by shooting leg pain at the moment an identical twin fractured his leg; a student instantly guessing to four decimal places the exact strength of a chemical solution that should have taken hours to work out; a mother seized by panic at the exact moment her baby across town took a bad fall.<br><br>My new focus also encouraged me to tune in to my patients in a new way. I gradually had to face the realization that there were things my patients had been only half telling me for years, things they viewed as too weird or risky to reveal for fear I wouldn't believe them or&#x2014;worse&#x2014;would think they really were crazy. Now when my patients began to hint at strange incidents, odd images, or funny coincidences, I worked harder to encourage them to explore their meaning. And I began hearing some remarkable things.<br><br>I was somewhat stalled with one deeply troubled patient, a woman who was isolated and very frightened of the world. For years she'd insisted she couldn't remember any of her dreams, and indeed she'd reported almost none to me through our work together. Then, during one session, she told me that the night before she'd dreamed of my going to Arizona. I had indeed been planning a trip to Arizona that week, but I'd told none of my colleagues or patients about it. I asked her, why Arizona? She had no idea, no associations. I told her that I was in fact going to Arizona and wondered if she'd somehow picked that up. For a moment, she was quiet. Then she hesitantly told me that she often had dreams in which she knew where people were going, and it turned out she was right. She couldn't begin to explain it. She'd learned not to tell people; it was too weird. She had had dreams like that as a child and her parents had raged at her and called her crazy. They would sometimes beat her until she said she'd made it all up. So she'd learned to shut up and started pretending that she didn't have dreams, that a lot of things she experienced weren't real. Pretending to others, to herself, had made her feel safe, but it had also made her feel that she wasn't very real.<br><br>That exchange with my patient was a turning point in her psychotherapy. It was also a turning point for me. My evident curiosity about her dream had liberated a flood of experiences. As my patient started believing that I could believe her&#x2014;and considered her neither crazy nor dangerous&#x2014;a new world opened up between us. She began for the first time telling me about other bizarrely intuitive experiences, and about how they terrified her. Bit by bit, her comfort in the world took new root. Her life changed in profoundly positive ways. She told me that she started feeling she could be real.</p><h2>The Witch of Willow Hall</h2><p><strong>Two centuries after the Salem witch trials, there&#x2019;s still one witch left in Massachusetts.

Previously seen in Death of a Cad , Hamish here departs from the sleepy precincts of his native Lochdub for a health farm on the gale-swept isle of Eileencraig to spend Christmas as guest of owner Jane Weatherby, who is upset by recent accidents that have befallen her since a local soothsayer saw death in Jane's tea leaves. Beset by assorted emotions, including his attraction to a fellow guest, widowed cookbook author Harriet Shaw, and occasionally nasty interactions among the others of the group, the normally lugubrious Hamish is at first inclined to blame the owner's troubles on coincidence. But when another guest, a snobbish, pontificating Glaswegian, turns up dead on a shoreline crag, Hamish, accompanied by Harriet, leaves no stone unturned to find the solution to the crime. As Christmas puddings--and yuletide mysteries--go, this one is a plum--a perfectly paced tale, told with just the right light touch. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Collected Stories (Vintage Classics)</h2><p>The most complete collection available of Willa Cather's remarkable short fiction,<i> Collected Stories</i>&nbsp;brings together all&nbsp;the&nbsp;stories published in book form during her lifetime along with two additional volumes&nbsp;compiled after her death. <br><br>These nineteen stories&nbsp;resonate with&nbsp;all&nbsp;the great themes that Cather staked out like tracts of fertile land: the plight of people hungry for beauty in a country that has no room for it; the mysterious arc of human lives; and the ways&nbsp;the American frontier transformed the strangers who came to it, turning them imperceptibly into Americans.

Geary and the others called them &#x201c;dark ships&#x201d; because their hulls were a duskier shade than most warships&#x2019;, perhaps because of special stealth materials. It hadn&#x2019;t been the crews of the dark ships that had committed the atrocities at Atalia and at Indras Star System but the dark ships themselves. The dark ships lacked human crews who could have overridden automated systems that had developed deadly glitches or perhaps been deliberately sabotaged by any of a variety of malware. Having finally won the century-long war against the Syndicate Worlds, the Alliance government had decided not to place its faith in the men and women who had paid the price for that victory, instead placing its trust in robotic systems that had already set ablaze two star systems.</p><p>Geary&#x2019;s Task Force Dancer had left Varandal with twelve battle cruisers, eight heavy cruisers, thirteen light cruisers, and twenty-five destroyers. The battle cruiser <i>Adroit</i> had been lost in the fighting at Atalia, along with the light cruiser <i>Lancer</i> and the destroyers <i>Kururi</i> and <i>Sabar</i>. Four battle cruisers, <i>Leviathan</i>, <i>Dragon</i>, <i>Steadfast</i>, and <i>Valiant</i>, along with some heavy cruisers and destroyers, had remained at Atalia to assist damaged ships and recover wreckage from destroyed dark ships.</p><p>Only seven battle cruisers were left in the pursuit force.</p><p>That would be enough. If they could catch the surviving dark ships, which had fled from the destruction they had wrought at Atalia.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;ARE automatic software updates disabled for <i>Dauntless</i>&#x2019;s systems?&#x201d; Geary asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; Tanya could be informal at other times, but now she was sharp, precise, and dangerous, a human weapon honed by the last decades of the brutal war with the Syndics. &#x201c;My people are actively monitoring all systems, and if something tries overriding the block on updates, they have orders to shut down those systems and do a cold reboot from last-day backups.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Geary said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a hell of a thing not to be able to trust our own software.&#x201d;</p><p>Desjani shook her head. &#x201c;We could never completely trust our software. It wasn&#x2019;t just flaws and glitches, it was also all the malware that enemy hackers could come up with to cause our software to misbehave. Humans separate from the machines are the only firewalls proven to be reliable enough. That&#x2019;s why we always kept humans in the loop, for those times when the software got its artificial little brains twisted.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2018;Always&#x2019; until those dark ships were built,&#x201d; Geary said, his tones tight with anger.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; She leaned closer and spoke more quietly. &#x201c;If the dark ships went berserk after they arrived at Varandal, like they did at Atalia, stopping them from doing a lot of damage might be impossible for us. They were nearly two hours ahead of us when they jumped for Varandal, and if they accelerated after they left jump space, they will have opened that lead. And none of the defenses at Varandal will be able to see the dark ships at all to counter them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Geary said, trying not to let his frustration sound too clearly. &#x201c;Thanks to official software updates designed to keep us blind to the dark ships. Are the software patches that fix the damage caused by those updates ready to send as soon as we arrive at Varandal?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir. The First Fleet ships still at Varandal will install the patches on your say-so because you&#x2019;re the fleet commander, but other Alliance forces not directly reporting to you may not,&#x201d; she reminded him. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll argue that these are unauthorized modifications to official software, so they need approval from their own chain of command to install them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If they&#x2019;re already getting shot up by warships that are invisible to their sensors, they may be motivated to ignore regulations concerning unauthorized software modifications.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One minute to exit from jump space,&#x201d; Lieutenant Castries called from her watch station at the back of the bridge.</p><p>Geary fixed his eyes on his display. A marker to one side confirmed that <i>Dauntless</i>&#x2019;s weapons systems, like those of the other warships in this pursuit force, were set to open fire immediately if any dark ships were within range when the Alliance warships left jump space. He didn&#x2019;t think they would be, though. The artificial-intelligence routines governing the dark ships&#x2019; tactical decisions were apparently closely based on Geary&#x2019;s own methods, and under these circumstances, if he had been the commander of the dark ships, he would not have attempted an ambush against a force with as much an advantage in firepower as Task Force Dancer still possessed.</p><p>The jolt of transition from the gray nothingness of jump space back to the real universe hit Geary. He was barely aware of the sudden reappearance of the stars in the endless blackness of space, his mind dazed by the transition, but even while fighting off the effects of the exit from jump, Geary noticed that none of <i>Dauntless</i>&#x2019;s weapons were firing.</p><p>His display swam back into focus as Geary concentrated on it.</p><p>Desjani was a second faster than he was in getting her mind working right again. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re heading for the hypernet gate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To attack it, or to use it to get away?&#x201d; he wondered aloud. &#x201c;At least they&#x2019;re not moving into the star system to attack the ships and facilities.&#x201d;</p><p>Space had no up or down, no east or west to determine directions, so humans had made up their own. Every star system had a plane in which planets orbited. One side of that plane was labeled up, the other down. Any direction toward the star was starboard or starward, while any direction away from the star was port. The conventions were simple, but they worked to give common references for ships that might be pointed in any direction, upside down or at right angles to each other.</p><p>The dark ships that had escaped from Atalia, two battle cruisers, one heavy cruiser, and five destroyers, were to port of Geary&#x2019;s ships and diving down slightly as they moved at a steady point two light speed for the hypernet gate orbiting six light-hours from the jump point where Geary&#x2019;s ships had just arrived. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re three hours&#x2019; travel time ahead of us. We won&#x2019;t have any chance of catching them before they reach the gate,&#x201d; Desjani said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d better hope they&#x2019;re running and that their warped artificial brains haven&#x2019;t decided the gate is also an enemy target.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Status signals from the gate indicate that the safe-collapse mechanism is operational,&#x201d; reported Lieutenant Yuon, the weapons systems watch-stander on <i>Dauntless</i>&#x2019;s bridge.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Lieutenant. At least if the dark ships do attack it, we don&#x2019;t have to worry about the gate&#x2019;s setting off a nova-scale explosion when it collapses. They&#x2019;ll reach the gate in another twenty-seven hours.&#x201d; She ran some quick calculations. &#x201c;There are two destroyers at the gate. Maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. damn. The only other units already at Varandal that are positioned to be able to intercept the dark ships are several more destroyers and light cruisers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Those wouldn&#x2019;t stand a chance even if they could see the dark ships,&#x201d; Geary said. &#x201c;We may not be able to catch the dark ships, but we can stay on their tails.&#x201d; He tapped a comm control. &#x201c;All units in Task Force Dancer, immediate execute accelerate to point two five light speed, come port two five degrees, down zero three degrees.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are we going to chase them through the hypernet gate?&#x201d; Desjani asked.</p><p>&#x201c;If we have to,&#x201d; Geary said. &#x201c;We have to find their base, wherever it is.&#x201d; He checked the fuel cell status on his ships and let out an angry breath. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to leave our destroyers here if we do that. Their fuel supplies are getting too low. Now, let&#x2019;s get the word out to everyone here,&#x201d; Geary added, his mood and his voice grim. He could see the many defenses at Varandal, the numerous warships and installations, all at standby readiness because the war with the Syndics had at last ended. &#x201c;Why aren&#x2019;t they reporting peacetime readiness instead of standby?&#x201d; Geary grumbled.</p><p>&#x201c;Because nobody but you remembers what peacetime readiness is,&#x201d; Desjani reminded him. &#x201c;And if the attack on Indras by those dark ships causes the Syndics to retaliate, this peace business may already be over with before the rest of us can figure out what it means.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re wrong about that. At least if the Syndics attack our defenses, we will be able to see <i>them</i>.&#x201d; Even after experiencing on these ships how secret software modifications had left Alliance sensors unable to see the dark ships, it was still hard to grasp that everything else in this star system would be totally unaware of the dark ships that were passing through. Many of those defenses were too far off to have seen the dark ships yet regardless, of course, let alone the more recent arrival of Geary&#x2019;s ships. Light only moved at about eighteen million kilometers a minute, so with distances inside a star system measured in hundreds of millions or billions of kilometers, even light took a while to get places.</p><p>But other defenses, other ships closer to this edge of the star system, should have seen the dark ships by now. If their own software were not blinding them to the presence of the hostile forces.</p><p>&#x201c;What you are about to do will raise hell,&#x201d; Desjani commented.</p><p>&#x201c;I know that,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Are you advising me not to do it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Her grin was fierce. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking forward to it.&#x201d;</p><p>Geary couldn&#x2019;t help a tense, humorless smile in return, then composed himself, touched the transmit command, and began sending the message he had been rehearsing during the long days in jump space since leaving Atalia. &#x201c;All units in the First Fleet, there are hostile forces in this star system that your software is blocking all sight of. These are not, repeat not, enigma warships. Our best estimate is that these are fully automated combatants that have slipped whatever controls were supposed to limit their actions.&#x201d;</p><p>He paused a moment to let that sink in before continuing. &#x201c;We have engaged in combat with those forces at Atalia, where they, without provocation or warning, attacked Alliance as well as civilian shipping and caused extensive destruction and loss of life. These hostile warships have already attacked Alliance warships and killed Alliance personnel. My task force is in pursuit of these ships, which are currently en route to Varandal&#x2019;s hypernet gate. Based on their actions at Indras and Atalia, it must be assumed that any Alliance or civilian ships they encounter will be attacked and destroyed.</p><p>&#x201c;Attached is a set of software patches you are to install on your ships. Disable automatic updates and permit no other updates until I personally authorize it. Your combat, maneuvering, sensor, database, and other systems contain hidden subroutines that mask the presence of the hostile warships. Once you have implemented the software patches we are sending, we will forward identifying information on the hostile warships. If we sent that information now, your own communications systems would strip out all traces of anything related to the hostile warships. These software patches are personally authorized by me as commander of the First Fleet. Geary, out.&#x201d;</p><p>He tapped in another command, this one aimed at the two destroyers on picket duty at the hypernet gate. &#x201c;</p></p><h2>Examkrackers MCAT 101 Passages: Cars: Critical Analysis &amp; Reasoning Skills</h2><p>This product is used and has pencil marks in it.

Concurrently, the body has become a signifier for the reproduction crisis generated by the neoliberal turn in capitalist development and for the international surge in institutional repression and public violence. In <i>Beyond the Periphery of the Skin</i>, lifelong activist and bestselling author Silvia Federici examines these complex processes, placing them in the context of the history of the capitalist transformation of the body into a work-machine, expanding on one of the main subjects of her first book, <i>Caliban and the Witch</i>. In this process she confronts some of the most important questions for contemporary radical political projects. What does &#x201c;the body&#x201d; mean, today, as a category of social/political action? What are the processes, institutional or anti-systemic, by which it is constituted? How do we dismantle the tools by which our bodies have been &#x201c;enclosed&#x201d; and collectively reclaim our capacity to govern them?</p><p><b>Silvia Federici</b> is a feminist writer, teacher, and militant. In 1972 she cofounded the International Feminist Collective that launched the Wages for Housework campaign. Her books include <i>Witches, Witch-Hunting, and Women</i>; <i>Caliban and the Witch</i>; <i>Re-enchanting the World</i>;<i></i>and <i>Revolution at Point Zero.</i></p><h2>Martha&#39;s Entertaining: A Year of Celebrations</h2><p>In this exquisite and very personal book, Martha Stewart welcomes you into her world, where she entertains in the expressive and beautiful style that she has made so famous.

The murder of Matthew McKay&#x2019;s son, Jordan, sent him on a journey in search of ways to communicate with his son despite fears and uncertainty. Here he recounts his efforts including past-life and between-lives hypnotic regressions, a technique called induced after-death communication, channeled writing, and more.<br><br>McKay, a psychologist and researcher, ultimately learned how to reach his son. In this book he provides extraordinary revelations direct from Jordan about the soul&#x2019;s life after death, how karma works, why we incarnate, why there is so much pain in the world, the single force that connects us, and our future as souls. Unlike many books about after-death communication, near-death experiences, and past-life memories, this is a book for those who do not believe yet yearn to know what happens after death.

Percival (1868 - 1953) In 1893, and twice during the next fourteen years, Harold Percival had the unique experience of being conscious of Consciousness, a potent spiritual and noetic enlightenment. Percival stated, Being conscious of Consciousness reveals the unknown to the one who has been so conscious. These experiences enabled him to know about any subject by a particular method of focusing he called real thinking. Because his body had to be still while he engaged in this process, he dictated whenever assistance was available. It was through this method, and over a thirty-four year period, that Thinking and Destiny was written. Mr. Percival was genteel and modest for all his wisdom, a gentleman of incorruptible honesty and moral standards. He preferred to leave his personality in the background. It was because of this that he did not wish to write an autobiography or have a biography written. His intention was that the validity of the statements not be influenced by his personality. --I do not presume to preach to anyone; I do not consider myself a preacher or a teacher. Were it not that I am responsible for the book, I would prefer that my personality be not named as its author. The greatness of the subjects about which I offer information, relieves and frees me from self-conceit and forbids the plea of modesty. I dare make strange and startling statements to the conscious and immortal self that is in every human body; and I take for granted that the individual will decide what he will or will not do with the information presented.-- --H. W. Percival It has been stated that no one could meet Mr. Percival without feeling that they had met a truly remarkable human being. His works represent a towering accomplishment in addressing the true state, and potential, of the human.</p><h2>New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law (Study Edition)</h2><p>Now in paperback!

The stories range from Grossman&#x2019;s first success, &#x201c;In the Town of Berdichev,&#x201d; a piercing reckoning with the cost of war, to such haunting later works as &#x201c;Mama,&#x201d; based on the life of a girl who was adopted at the height of the Great Terror by the head of the NKVD and packed off to an orphanage after her father&#x2019;s downfall. The girl grows up struggling with the discovery that the parents she cherishes in memory are part of a collective nightmare that everyone else wishes to forget. <i>The Road</i> also includes the complete text of Grossman&#x2019;s harrowing report from Treblinka, one of the first anatomies of the workings of a death camp; &#x201c;The Sistine Madonna,&#x201d; a reflection on art and atrocity; as well as two heartbreaking letters that Grossman wrote to his mother after her death at the hands of the Nazis and carried with him for the rest of his life.<br> Meticulously edited and presented by Robert Chandler, <i>The Road</i> allows us to see one of the great figures of twentieth-century literature discovering his calling both as a writer and as a man.</p></p><p>Vasily Semyonovich Grossman was born on December 12, 1905, in Berdichev, a Ukrainian town that was home to one of Europe&#x2019;s largest Jewish communities. In 1934 he published both &#x201c;In the Town of Berdichev&#x201d;&#x2014;a short story that won the admiration of such diverse writers as Isaak Babel, Maksim Gorky, and Boris Pilnyak&#x2014;and a novel, Glyukauf, about the life of the Donbass miners. During the Second World War, Grossman worked as a war correspondent for the army newspaper Red Star, covering nearly all of the most important battles from the defense of Moscow to the fall of Berlin. His vivid yet sober &#x201c;The Hell of Treblinka&#x201d; (late 1944), one of the first articles in any language about a Nazi death camp, was translated and used as testimony in the Nuremberg Trials. His novel For a Just Cause (originally titled Stalingrad) was published in 1952 and then fiercely attacked. A new wave of purges&#x2014;directed against the Jews&#x2014;was about to begin; if not for Stalin&#x2019;s death, in March 1953, Grossman would almost certainly have been arrested. During the next few years Grossman, while enjoying public success, worked on his two masterpieces, neither of which was to be published in Russia until the late 1980s: Life and Fate and Everything Flows. The KGB confiscated the manuscript of Life and Fate in February 1961. Grossman was able, however, to continue working on Everything Flows, a novel even more critical of Soviet society than Life and Fate, until his last days in the hospital. He died on September 14, 1964, on the eve of the twenty-third anniversary of the massacre of the Jews of Berdichev, in which his mother had died.<br><br>Robert Chandler has edited and translated numerous Russian titles, including Vasily Grossman&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Life and Fate</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Everything Flows</i>. He is the editor of&nbsp;<i>Russian Short Stories from Pushkin to Buida</i>&nbsp;and the author of a biography of Alexander Pushkin. He has co-translated numerous works by Andrey Platonov, including the award-winning&nbsp;<i>Soul</i>, which is published by NYRB Classics. He lives in London.<br><br>Elizabeth Chandler is a co-translator of Andrey Platonov&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Soul</i>&nbsp;and Alexander Pushkin&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Captain&#x2019;s Daughter</i>.<br><br>Olga Mukovnikova is a freelance translator, translation reviser for Amnesty International, and a member of the Chartered Institute of Linguists.<p>"Another superb translated work to appear [in 2010] was <i>The Road</i>, comprising Vasily Grossman's short stories and journalism. Although occasionally tainted by propaganda, his stories &#x2013; particularly the later ones &#x2013; are extraordinary, punctuated with small details that stop the eyes and drag them back to read certain phrases again. &#x2014; <i>The Guardian</i></p><p>"Grossman's unsparing, literary account of the horrific ways Nazi Germany implemented its ethnic-cleansing program at Treblinka was one of the first reports of a death camp anywhere in Europe and eventually provided prosecutors at the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal with crucial background information. The surprise is that up until now and English-language translation of Grossman's lengthy article has never been published in its entirety. That will soon change with the publication of <i>The Road</i>, a collection of Grossman's best short stories and war-time articles, including 'The Hell of Treblinka.'" --Tobias Grey, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>&#x201c;Grossman&#x2019;s greatness is manifested in a constant ability to surprise his readers: where we lazily expect darkness and gloom, Grossman provides lightness and humour; what might seem at first glance to be narrow polemic turns out, when paid more attention, to have the grandeur of tragedy.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;David Lea,&nbsp;<i>The Literateur</i><br><br>&#x201c;Vasily Grossman is the Tolstoy of the USSR.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Martin Amis<br><br>&#x201c;...the collection is a treasure trove that lends the reader an insider's understanding of what it was like to live through the Soviet era, at the same time as it introduces us to Grossman's enduring preoccupation with the wonder and terror of humanity....A wonderful collection, this &#x2013; an introduction to the man and his times that also tells us much about his love, his pity and his faith.&#x201d; &#x2014;Gillian Slovo, <i>The Guardian<br></i><br> &#x201c;Grossman&#x2019;s work excavates from the Soviet rubble vital artifacts of the bitter, the tragic, the self-sacrificing, the indomitable and, ultimately, the inspiring..... [<i>The Road</i> is] a volume that is sensitive to Grossman&#x2019;s often lyrical language and frames each entry within its time through comprehensive notes.&#x201d; &#x2014;Ken Kalfus, <i>The New York Times</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;[Grossman&#x2019;s] report &#x2018;The Hell of Treblinka&#x2019; was one of the first to report on an extermination camp, and was used as testimony in the Nuremberg trials. &#x2018;Treblinka&#x201d; is included in the recently published book, <i>The Road</i> &#x2014; an original collection of Grossman&#x2019;s short stories, essays, and letters translated into English for the first time.... This collection serves as a fantastic view into the man&#x2019;s work, and will hopefully lead readers to seek out his two books of fiction put out a few years earlier.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jason Diamond, Jewcy<br>&#x201c;Soviet author Grossman volunteered for the army when the Germans invaded in 1941 and spent more than three years as a special correspondent at the front for the army newspaper Red Star. His wartime writing established him as a major "voice" of war&#x2013;a status resembling in many ways that of Ernie Pyle in America...Grossman was a perceptive observer with an eye for essential detail. His vignettes of the fighting at Kursk and the battles that brought the Red Army into Berlin are models of combat reporting, and the elegiac realism of his description of Treblinka merits wide anthologizing in Holocaust literature.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><h2>Black Butler, Vol. 12 (Black Butler, 12)</h2><p>The decks of the Campania run red with blood when the corpses brought back to a semblance of life by the Aurora Society&#39;s &#39;absolute salvation&#39; turn on the ship&#39;s passengers in a ghoulish farce.

An older generation of scholars expected that America and the rest of the Western world was headed inexorably toward secularization and the end of religion. America is undoubtedly secular in many ways, and our constitutional order requires a clear distinction between faith communities and government. Yet from the colonial era to the present, American men and women have been, and have remained, a pervasively religious people.</p><p>In <em>America's Religious History</em>, leading historian Thomas S. Kidd traces the theological and ethnic diversity and enduring strength of American religion, with special attention to Christianity and evangelical faith.

The unambiguous Buddhist perception of reality is transmitted in profound, simple language by one of the foremost masters in the Tibetan tradition. Dzogchen is to take the final result, the state of enlightenment itself, as path. This is the style of simply picking the ripened fruit or the fully bloomed flowers. Tulku Urgyen&#39;s way of communicating this wisdom was to awaken the individual to their potential and reveal the methods to acknowledge and stabilize that prospective. His distinctive teaching style was widely known for its unique directness in introducing students to the nature of mind in a way that allowed immediate experience. This book offers the direct oral instructions of a master who inspired admiration, delight in practice, and deep trust and confidence in the Buddhist way.</p><p>Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche (1920-1996) was one of the outstanding Tibetan Buddhist teachers of his generation. Forced into exile by the Communist invasion of Tibet, he came to settle in the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal. Though spending over 25 years in retreat, he not only taught extensively, but also founded numerous monasteries and retreat centers the world over. He is the author of such popular books as <i>Rainbow Painting</i> and <i>As It Is Vols. I &amp; II.</i>"Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche&#x2019;s direct oral instructions inspired admiration, delight in practice, and deep trust and confidence in the teachings among those who met him. His words always helped their minds, in the sense that applying even some of his advice reduced disturbing emotions and naturally allowed compassion, love and insight to blossom."- Ch�kyi Nyima Rinpoche, <i>Introductory Teachings</i></p><h2>Remember Why You Play: Faith, Football, and a Season to Believe</h2><p>If you enjoyed <i>Friday Night Lights</i>, this book is a must-read. <i>Remember Why You Play</i> documents the lives, struggles, and triumphs of the players and coaches of Faith Christian School in Grapevine, Texas. <br>Sports columnist and author David Thomas followed the team for a full season, recording a story that will inspire readers to understand that relationships are more important than winning. <br>One of the key events was a game that Faith Christian played against the Gainesville State Tornadoes, a school for convicted juvenile offenders. The story of this spectacular game is being made into a movie, titled <i>One Heart</i>, with an anticipated release in November 2010.

When she was a child, the border zone was rumored to be an easier crossing point into the West than the Berlin Wall, and it swarmed with soldiers and spies. On holidays in the &#x201c;Red Riviera&#x201d; on the Black Sea, she remembers playing on the beach only miles from a bristling electrified fence whose barbs pointed inward toward the enemy: the citizens of the totalitarian regime.</p><p>Kassabova discovers a place that has been shaped by successive forces of history: the Soviet and Ottoman empires, and, older still, myth and legend. Her exquisite portraits of fire walkers, smugglers, treasure hunters, botanists, and border guards populate the book. There are also the ragged men and women who have walked across Turkey from Syria and Iraq. But there seem to be nonhuman forces at work here too: This densely forested landscape is rich with curative springs and Thracian tombs, and the tug of the ancient world, of circular time and animism, is never far off.</p><p><i>Border </i>is a scintillating, immersive travel narrative that is also a shadow history of the Cold War, a sideways look at the migration crisis troubling Europe, and a deep, witchy descent into interior and exterior geographies.</p></p><p><b>Kapka Kassabova</b> is the author of three poetry collections, the novel <i>Villa Pacifica</i>, and the acclaimed memoirs <i>Street Without a Name: Childhood and Other Misadventures in Bulgaria</i> and <i>Twelve Minutes of Love: A Tango Story</i>.

Dong-ho, a young teenager looks for his friend amidst the rubble, clinging to the proximity of his friend&#x2019;s last breath. Refusing to go home, Dong-ho is murdered. From there, Kang&#x2019;s epic novel blooms outward, telling the stories of friends, family, prisoners, editors that are haunted, ruined and ravaged by the atrocities of that day. Kang is uncompromisingly raw in her portrayal of the violence, censorship and political corruption that pervades the lives of these South Koreans. She unfurls how trauma extends across generations, how forgetting is impossible and how human touch can still incite hope: &#x201c;it felt as they were rethreading the sinews of that world heart, patching up the fissures from which blood had flowed, making it beat again.&#x201d; <em>Human Acts</em> is a triumph of sustained force and poetry. <em>--Al Woodworth, The Amazon Book Review</em>Han Kang was born in Gwangju, South Korea, and moved to Seoul at the age of ten.

As the story begins, Andy Chase, who holds a license as a second mate is looking for a ship. In less than ten years, the United States Merchant Marine has shrunk from more than two thousand ships to fewer than four hundred, and Chase faces the scarcity of jobs from which all American merchant mariners have been suffering.</p><p>With John McPhee along, Chase finds a job as a second mate aboard the S.S. Stella Lykes, captained by the extraordinary Paul McHenry Washburn. The journey takes them on a forty-two day run down the Pacific coast of South America, with stops to unload and pick up freight at such ports as Cartagena, Valparaiso, Balboa, Lima, and Guayaquil&#x2015;an area notorious for pirates. As the crew make their ocean voyage, they tell sea stories of other runs and other ships, tales of disaster, stupidity, greed, generosity, and courage. Through the journey itself and the tales told emerge the history and character of a fascinating calling.</p></p><p><p><b>John McPhee</b> was born in Princeton, New Jersey, and was educated at Princeton University and Cambridge University.

He lives in Princeton, New Jersey.</p>Looking for a Ship <br> Andy was worried about the Ben Sawyer Bridge. He thought of it stuck open, and saw in his mind's eye an unending line of stifled cars, his own among them. If his neurons seemed hyperactive, they had some reason to be. On the other hand, how often did this drawbridge get stuck? Once a year? Three times every two years? Whatever the statistics might be, they would make no difference to Andy. The drawbridge had stuck open one afternoon with him on the wrong side, and the delay was so prolonged that he checked into a motel and caught up on sleep. On that day, he wasn't going anywhere important. On this day, he allowed a minimum of three hours to complete a journey of thirty minutes. He was looking for a ship. In Andy's wallet was a National Shipping Card that had been stamped in Boston ten and a half months before, registering under his name, George Anderson Chase, the date, the hour, and the minute when he arrived in a unionhall after leaving his last ship. The older the card, the better the prospects for a new job. If the card were to go twelve months unused, it would roll over--lose all seniority, and begin again. Meanwhile strongly competitive, it had all but reached the status of a killer card. In the evolving decline of the United States Merchant Marine, qualified people seeking work so greatly outnumbered the jobs there were to fill that you almost had to hold a killer card or your chances were slim for shipping out. You went to a union hall, presented the card in person at a job call, and if someone tossed in an older card you stayed on the beach. From his home, in Maine, Andy had come to Charleston this time because he thought that shipping cards deadlier than his would be more numerous in Boston or New York. On sheer speculation, I joined him, our idea being that when he got himself a ship he would ask the shipping company if I could go along on the voyage as a P.A.C.--Person in Addition to Crew. Andy said, "I probably have a better chance out of Charleston. Fewer people. Less competition. A fairly steady stream of ships." Besides, he had a place to stay. His wife's mother lived on an island whose connection to the mainland was the Ben Sawyer Bridge. We had no idea where we would be going, if anywhere. We had gear for cool weather and gear for the tropics. Looking for a ship, Andy had once spent two months fruitlessly hanging around the union hall in Charleston. He had put in many weeks in New York with the same result. He once went as far as Puerto Rico. He spent two weeks there going to the hall. He got no ship. He tried Charleston onhis way home, and with great luck got a ship in two days. The ship he got in Charleston was called the Puerto Rican. He was on it four months, sailing as third mate, coastwise. A chemical tanker, it blew up, out of San Francisco, on a later voyage. It broke in half. I had known Andy for several years. I had been to his home in Maine. I had accompanied him to the New York hall of the International Organization of Masters, Mates, and Pilots. The New York hall is in Jersey City. On the PATH train, Andy said, "The union halls are not really halls. They're like dentists' offices." This one was a room on the east side of the fifteenth floor of a fairly new building at 26 Journal Square. The view of Manhattan was unimpeded from the midtown skyline to the towers of world trade. Andy was just checking out New York. His card was only thirty days old, and he was taking the long chance of finding a short trip that no one else in his category would want. By union rules, he could not do his checking by telephone. If he called the hall, the dispatcher would not tell him who was competing for what. One of the mariners in the hall was a friend of Andy's named Bryan Thomas, who explained to me, "You might trust a friend to check out a hall for you, but what friend? Almost anyone would tell you not to bother coming, no matter what the work situation might be." He went on to say that he had been surprised as he shook my hand, because "there seemed to be some sincerity" in the warmth of my hello. Andy told him that I was no threat. Thomas said, "There is so much hunger for work thatno one is happy to see anybody else. We are a brotherhood, so we hate each other." Andy said, "Nobody ever does anybody a favor. You can't beg a job off of somebody. It just isn't done." The New York hall was about the size of a high-school classroom, and an interior window separated it from a small office. At one-thirty, the time of the job call, action would take place at the window. Job sheets, if any, would be posted on a corkboard. Meanwhile, there was a clipboard with a sheaf of papers headed "OFFSHORE JOBS," showing positions that had been picked up in recent weeks and the age of the cards that had won them. Some of the runs were "Coastwise," "Far East," "South America," "N. Europe," "R/World , "W. Africa," "Caribbean," "Med," "Panama." Andy said,"South America is the romance run--beautiful women, beautiful ports." Andy had never been to South America. To make unexpected replacements, owners will fly people to foreign ports. In extremes, they have used the Concorde. Andy once turned up for a job call at the New York hall and that night was on a flight to Athens. On each offshore-job sheet was a "Reason" column, explaining why the job had come open: "LOA" (leave of absence), "Quit," "Fired." One sheet had called for a mariner to fly off at once on Iberia to Gibraltar. "Rotary" was the reason. He replaced someone whose hundred and twenty days were up--the maximum sea time allowed by the union, in the interest of rationing available work. As one-thirty neared, more than thirty mates werefanned out around the office door like fish at the mouth of a tributary stream. They wore nylon jackets, down vests, rubber-soled moccasins, bluejeans, cotton-flannel shirts, fatigue jackets, trenchcoats, sweaters. Nobody looked nautical. Two were in suits and ties. This could have been any carpenters' or plumbers' union hall. Add cowboy boots and it could have been a union hall in Fairbanks at the fading end of the pipeline boom. "The majority don't tell you what they do in their other lives," Andy said. He had shipped out with restaurateurs, real-estate entrepreneurs, and a lot of people who, in the proximity of fresh water, "just go fishing." The cook on one of Andy's ships was a male stripper. Andy had shipped out with an engine-room wiper in his sixties who called his broker from every port. Andy had shipped out with a sax player who had lost two fingers when they became caught between a mooring line and a capstan. For unrelated reasons, he was known as Goldfinger. The dispatcher came to the window. The thirty-odd faces lifted in attention. Loudly, the dispatcher said, "Nothing on the offshore," and he read the particulars of four night-mate jobs--eight-hour relief work on docked ships--in Port Elizabeth and Howland Hook. That was it. That was the work available for all those mates. They showed no surprise and quickly dispersed. Sometimes, if you hang around a union hall after all the other people have left, a desperate last-minute call will come in, and if you want the job you can have it. "You dash down and join the ship,"Andy said. "But that is very rare." Shipping out that way is known as "a pierhead jump." On this day, no one was jumping. Andy was sixteen when he dropped out of school and first went to sea. Eventually, he finished school but intended not to go to college. After another year at sea, however, he enrolled at Maine Maritime Academy, in Castine, and in 1979 he became a Merchant Marine licensed officer, a third mate. Before long, he was hanging around New Orleans and New York, a month each, attending daily job calls. In those days, jobs were a little more plentiful, but for someone that green there was no ship. Becoming frantic, he tried Boston, the anachronist center of commerce, where he found a square-rigger, a barkentine, casting off to do whale research in the Caribbean. She was called Regina Maris. He shipped out under sail. The irony of Andy's career is this: as his sea time accumulated and his status in the union improved, his increasing potentiality as a job seeker was largely offset by a decreasing number of jobs, as Chapter 10 started coming to the end for the United States Merchant Marine. After three weeks in New York one spring, he got a job on a container ship called Sea-Land Oakland that shuttled between Rotterdam and the Persian Gulf. The temperature of the Red Sea was ninety-five degrees and the air was over a hundred. In 1983, he had luck in Charleston, where he went to the hall for three weeks and, with a better card than four competitors, became third mate of the LASH Pacifico, a Prudential Lines ship, on which he spent six months andmade sixty thousand dollars. He was twenty-eight when he joined the ship. He had been married less than a month before. The sixty thousand dollars was actually a full year's income, because, by terms then set by the union, the six months of work were followed by six of obligatory vacation. And then another six of utter frustration looking for a ship. He failed to get one in New York, in New Orleans, in Port Everglades, in Charleston. Tension grew within him as the end of a year approached. He had seen a man get a ship with a card that was three hundred and sixty-four days twenty-three hours and fifty-six minutes old. ("He was sweating.") For Andy, the end came without a ship. He still refers funereally to "the day my card rolled over." He needed work so badly that he signed up as an able-bodied seaman on an integrated tug-barge operating between Perth Amboy and Duluth. He was a licensed officer of ocean ships on his way to the Great Lakes as a deckhand on a barge. To provide jobs of any kind for its increasingly distressed mariners, the Masters, Mates, and Pilots union arranged for five oceangoing tankers to be crewed with union members, right down to the last deckie. Licensed officers accepted jobs as ordinary seamen, able-bodied seamen, and bosuns because they could not get other work. Andy sailed from Providence as an A.B. on the tanker Spray. Later, for many months, he was bosun on the Spray. He was not entirely troubled by this. It gave him a chance to practice marlinspike seamanship--knot tying, wire splicing, rope splicing, rigging. There is an expression in the MerchantMarine that describes officers who are former deckhands or engine-room wipers and rose to licensed rank not by going to college--not by graduating from one of the seven maritime academies--but by passing examinations after learning on the job. Such people are said to have come up the hawsepipe. Hawsepipes are the apertures in the bows of ships through which the anchor chains clatter. Hawsepipes are the eyes of Yangtze junks. When a big-enough ship is at anchor, a person can climb up one of the chains and make it through the hawsepipe to the fo'c'sle deck. To the question "What academy did you go to?" a licensed officer may answer, "I didn't. I came up the hawsepipe." Andy likes to say that he has been through the hawsepipe, too, but in the wrong direction. As someone who went to an academy, sailed third mate, earned his second mate's license, and then was forced to work as a deckhand, he will tell you that he was "stuffed <i>down</i> the hawsepipe." The United States Merchant Marine, the name of which suggests an assault on a valuable foreign beach, is not, as a good many people seem to think, a branch of military service. It is essentially a collective enterprise of competing private companies, flying the American flag on the sterns of their ships, employing American-citizen crews, and transporting cargoes throughout the world. Sail and steam, the United States grew in rank among nations on the aggressive reach of its Merchant Marine. American merchant ships once numbered in the thousands. The chimerical ship that Andy Chase and I went to look for in Charleston would not be a selection from a field that large.Diminishing rapidly, the number of American dry-cargo ships was already below two hundred, and there were about as many tankers. Not one commercial vessel was under construction in an American shipyard. In time of war, the Merchant Marine is a prominent participant. This civilian job--risky enough at any time--becomes exceptionally dangerous. During the Second World War, the percentage of deaths was higher in the Merchant Marine than it was in the Navy or the Army, and was exceeded only by the percentage of deaths in the Marine Corps. Something like eight hundred ships went down and six thousand five hundred sailors died. As prisoners of the Japanese, American merchant mariners were among those who built the bridge on the River Kwai. War, with its all-out sealifts--the Korean Sealift, the Vietnam Sealif--expands the merchant fleet. Afterward, the ships go out of service more rapidly than the sailors, and jobs are hard to come by. The unions close their membership books until numbers level out. By the late nineteen-seventies, the Second World War crowd was gone, and much of the Vietnam crowd. Books opened. There were days when Andy actually felt positive about his choice of career: "Much more young blood coming up now. It's starting to feel as if it's my Merchant Marine. My generation. Our turn has come." In the mid-eighties, "everything slammed shut again" as the United States Merchant Marine was competitively outbid by ships under foreign flags and was reduced to carrying less than five per cent of all oceangoing American cargo. One American company after another entered Chapter 11with its keel up and its screws in the air. Soon the Soviet merchant fleet was carrying at least ten times as much American cargo as the United States Merchant Marine, in direct trade between the two countries--a multiple that keeps growing through time. In 1988, the National Maritime Union sold its ninestory building at 346 West Seventeenth Street, Manhattan, which had medical facilities, a gymnasium, a sauna, a restaurant, a theatre, and a school, and--with its porthole windows--suggested an upended ship. The N.M.U., of course, was a sailors' union--the once very powerful organization of the unlicensed--and now it had lost a leveraged sellout, was called M. E. B. A. /N. M. U. , and had been merged with a branch of the Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association, an organization of engine-room officers. N.M.U. sailors who were looking for ships were reporting to a new address: 404 Lafayette Street, in the saddle of low structures that lie on the loose gravels between the high summits of midtown and Wall Street. The building looks like a warehouse that has seen its last ware. What doorway to use is not clear from the sidewalk and less so if someone is lying in it. Upstairs is a large low room where the bright polish of the maple floor does little to console the N.M. U. sailors for the lost symbol of their lovely hall. The job-call scene is much the same as it is elsewhere for the masters and mates. The board says "Killer Card Date: April 8," or whatever it happens to be. An N. M. U. card accrues seniority for only two hundred and ten days, and then rolls over. Say a car carrier belonging to Central Gulf is the only shipon the board, with two A.B. positions--vacation relief. That's all. And a short run to boot--San Juan. More than forty men are in the hall. Two jobs. It's a lively, noisy room, a hubbub of chatter, many styles of fits-all visored cap, leather jackets, running sh...</p><h2>The Miseducation of Cameron Post Movie Tie-in Edition</h2><p><p><strong>Now a major motion picture starring Chlo� Grace Moretz * </strong><strong>Sundance Grand Jury Prize Winner</strong></p><p>"LGBTQ cinema is out in force at Sundance Film Festival," proclaimed <em>USA Today</em>.

This book draws upon the wisdom and technical knowledge from desert farming traditions all around the world to offer time-tried strategies for:</p> <ul> <li>Building greater moisture-holding capacity and nutrients in soils</li> <li>Protecting fields from damaging winds, drought, and floods</li> <li>Harvesting water from uplands to use in rain gardens and terraces filled with perennial crops</li> <li>Delecting fruits, nuts, succulents, and herbaceous perennials that are best suited to warmer, drier climates</li> </ul> <p>Gary Paul Nabhan is one of the world's experts on the agricultural traditions of arid lands. For this book he has visited indigenous and traditional farmers in the Gobi Desert, the Arabian Peninsula, the Sahara Desert, and Andalusia, as well as the Sonoran, Chihuahuan, and Painted deserts of North America, to learn firsthand their techniques and designs aimed at reducing heat and drought stress on orchards, fields, and dooryard gardens. This practical book also includes colorful "parables from the field" that exemplify how desert farmers think about increasing the carrying capacity and resilience of the lands and waters they steward. It is replete with detailed descriptions and diagrams of how to implement these desert-adapted practices in your own backyard, orchard, or farm.</p> <p>This unique book is useful not only for farmers and permaculturists in the arid reaches of the Southwest or other desert regions. Its techniques and prophetic vision for achieving food security in the face of climate change may well need to be implemented across most of North America over the next half-century, and are already applicable in most of the semiarid West, Great Plains, and the U.S. Southwest and adjacent regions of Mexico.</p></p><p><p>Gary Paul Nabhan is an internationally celebrated nature writer, food and farming activist, and proponent of conserving the links between biodiversity and cultural diversity. He holds the W.K. Kellogg Endowed Chair in Sustainable Food Systems at the University of Arizona Southwest Center, where he works with students, faculty, and non-profits to build a more just, nutritious, sustainable, and climate-resilient foodshed spanning the US/Mexico border. He&#x2019;s also the author of numerous books, including <em>Growing Food in a Hotter, Drier Land</em>,<em> Renewing America&#x2019;s Food Traditions</em>, and <em>Chasing Chiles.</em> He lives in southern Arizona.</p><p><em><strong>Publishers Weekly-</strong></em></p> <p>&#x201c;Nabhan, an ethnobotanist, cofounder of Native Seeds/SEARCH, and prolific author, draws on his longtime relationships with the land and people of the Southwest U.S., together with wisdom from farmers and gardeners in Egypt, Mexico, and other dry places, to suggest solutions for growing food and developing agricultural resiliency as climate change affects wider swaths of the planet. He discusses using hedge fences (he calls them &#x201c;fredges&#x201d;) to minimize flood damage; choosing ancient and traditional methods for water management; soil building using local materials; terracing for fertility and erosion control; creating polycultures with perennials and drought-hardy plants; and attracting and supporting native pollinators. This information, which includes detailed instructions and lists of plants and pollinators, will undoubtedly be useful to farmers and gardeners facing more volatile weather patterns. Their spirits may lift as well with the book&#x2019;s somber but hopeful poetic tone, exemplified by Moroccan Sufi mystic and farmer Aziz Bousfiha, who is working to transform deserts into living oases: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not just activism I am talking about... I am talking about something larger, deeper: participating in the creation&#x2015;for that is the... expression of our love.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><em><strong>ForeWord Reviews-</strong></em></p> <p>&#x201c;Growing Food in a Hotter, Drier Land is Nabhan&#x2019;s instructive and focused how-to that advocates collective participation, place-based solutions, and &#x201c;mimicry&#x201d; of &#x201c;time-tried traditional practices from desert farmers around the world.&#x201d; And it all begins with the understanding that &#x201c;weather and food go hand in hand,&#x201d; and that their essential symbiosis is in peril.</p> <p>The summer of 2011 was one of the hottest ever recorded in the United States. The severe heat exacerbated an already dry landscape and produced extreme drought&#x2015;the effects of which had such a damaging impact on US agriculture that five hundred food-producing counties were declared disaster areas because they suffered weather-related crop failures.</p> <p>Summer wreaked more devastation in 2012. Nearly three thousand counties were declared disaster areas, while forty thousand new daily records for hot temperatures were reported across the country. By August, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization indicated that droughts across the Americas had caused global food prices to jump six percent in a single month.</p> <p>These scenarios are dreadful, but the practical advice and pragmatic solutions that Nabhan offers engender optimism. He shows how to reduce heat stress on plants and animals by establishing a &#x201c;boundary layer&#x201d; of leafy trees to provide a shade canopy. Nabhan encourages constructing a living fencerow from organic matter to sequester carbon, protect fields from floods and winds, and prevent soil erosion and nutrient runoff.</p> <p>For more than two thousand years, buried pottery pitchers have been used for crop irrigation in dry lands. Because of water scarcity, its practice is being revived, and Nabhan provides step-by-step instructions on how to construct this ancient, yet efficient irrigation system.</p> <p>Nabhan&#x2019;s guide is highly specialized, technical, and insightful. It is doubtful that a general reader would have the patience needed to complete it, but the book is a must-have instruction manual for surviving climate change for desert farmers, orchard growers, crop farmers, ranchers, and backyard gardeners.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Gary Nabhan&#x2019;s books never fail to inspire and inform me. This book is no exception. After just one read through I&#x2019;ve dog-eared, highlighted, and noted countless gems, facts, and stories to which I will return again and again. The pattern of the book makes this easy. Each section begins with a Warm-Up problem, followed by a Parable of people or natural systems addressing the problem. Principles and Premises distilled from the problem and parable, along with Planning and Practice tips then help me work cooperatively with the life around me to formulate solutions unique to my site&#x2019;s conditions and changing climate.</p> <p>Best of all, I feel I&#x2019;m part of an incredibly diverse, caring community as I do so, thanks to Gary sharing so many engaging examples of different people, cultures, and ecosystems doing likewise.

Fiona, the young rider of queen dragon Talenth, is about to assume the duties of a Weyrwoman when word spreads that dragons have begun succumbing to the new contagion. As more dragons sicken and die, Weyrleader B&#x2019;Nik and queen rider Lorana comb Fort Weyr&#x2019;s archives in a desperate search for clues from the past that may hold the solution to the plague. But could the past itself prove the pathway to salvation for Pern&#x2019;s imperiled dragons? Guided by a mysterious ally from a wholly unexpected place, and trusting in the dragon gift for transcending time, Fiona will join a risky expedition with far-reaching consequences for both Pern&#x2019;s future and her personal destiny.</p><p>Todd McCaffrey is the bestselling author of the Pern novel Dragonsblood, and the co-author, with his mother, Anne McCaffrey, of Dragon&#x2019;s Kin, Dragon&#x2019;s Fire, and Dragon Harper. A computer engineer, he currently lives in Los Angeles. Having grown up in Ireland with the epic of the Dragonriders of Pern,� he is bursting with ideas for new stories of that world, its people, and its dragons.<i>Chapter One<br><br>Heart, give voice to sing<br>Of life on dragonwings!<br><br>Fort Weyr, AL 507.11.17, Second Interval </i><br><br>&#x201c;...and you wouldn&#x2019;t believe how many holders they&#x2019;ve saved over the last ten Turns,&#x201d; Benden Weyrleader M&#x2019;tal said, continuing to press his case for the watch- whers. <br><br>The three remaining Weyrleaders had adjourned to Fort Weyr&#x2019;s Council Room to await the Hatching and confer. <br><br>C&#x2019;rion of Ista Weyr snorted and shook his head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, M&#x2019;tal, but the time&#x2019;s all wrong,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Threads will be falling all too soon and here you are with this radical notion of training dragons and watch- whers to fly Threads together at night.&#x201d; <br><br>M&#x2019;tal took a slow, calming breath to stifle the hot retort he wanted to make. He looked expectantly to K&#x2019;lior. <br><br>The youngest Weyrleader of Pern shifted uneasily under the gray- haired man&#x2019;s gaze. Well aware that M&#x2019;tal had been a Weyrleader since before K&#x2019;lior was born, he found it hard to refute such a length of experience. Of course, C&#x2019;rion was even older still and had made <i>his </i>feelings well- known. <br><br>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; M&#x2019;tal began again, his hands outstretched in a placating gesture, &#x201c;just think&#x2013;&#x201d; <br><br>He broke off as his ears detected the unmistakable hum of dragons at Hatching. He smiled and gestured at K&#x2019;lior. &#x201c;Weyrleader?&#x201d; <br><br>K&#x2019;lior was already on his feet and heading for the doorway that led to the Hatching Grounds. <br><br>Kindan and Kentai, Fort Weyr&#x2019;s harper, were waiting on the stairs to the viewing stands in the Hatching Grounds, ready to escort the more feeble or overly- excited holders up to a good perch. Kindan nodded to M&#x2019;tal as the Weyrleader passed by, still engrossed in fer�vent conversation with the Istan and Fort Weyrleaders. <br><br>&#x201c;I see D&#x2019;gan has departed,&#x201d; Kentai murmured to Kindan as the Weyrleaders climbed out of earshot.<br> <br>Kindan shrugged. He knew that M&#x2019;tal had not been counting on D&#x2019;gan&#x2019;s support anyway. He was less pleased at the looks he&#x2019;d seen on C&#x2019;rion&#x2019;s and K&#x2019;lior&#x2019;s faces&#x2013;neither looked very thrilled with what M&#x2019;tal was saying to them. Kindan, who was familiar with M&#x2019;tal&#x2019;s plan, shook his head. Couldn&#x2019;t the other Weyrleaders see that watch- whers, with their night- seeing eyes, were <i>supposed </i>to fly the night Threadfalls? <br><br>&#x201c;Lord Itaral, Lady Nelyssa,&#x201d; Kentai called as he spotted the Lord and Lady Holders of Ruatha Hold. He smiled as he spotted the third person in their party. &#x201c;I see that you&#x2019;ve convinced Lady Ilyssa to join you this time.&#x201d; He nodded to their young daughter and raised an elbow invitingly. &#x201c;May I escort you to your seats?&#x201d; <br><br>Ilyssa blushed, but, overcoming her embarrassed smile, curt�sied most elegantly and took his arm. <br><br>&#x201c;This is Kindan,&#x201d; Kentai said with a nod toward the other harper. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s come with Lord M&#x2019;tal from Benden Weyr.&#x201d; <br><br>Lady Nelyssa started at his name and peered at him more closely. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you the one&#x2013;&#x201d; She caught herself and rapidly switched her comment. &#x201c;&#x2013;I mean, aren&#x2019;t you the young man who gave up his watch- wher to Nuella, the WherMaster?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Among other things, I am known for that,&#x201d; Kindan agreed, in�clining his head politely and giving her a slight smile. He knew what she&#x2019;d started to say, and wondered if he would ever live down the stigma of the fire in the Harper Hall&#x2019;s Archive rooms. He hadn&#x2019;t been solely responsible, after all, and he&#x2019;d fought the hard�est to put the blaze out, preserving countless other Records . . . <br><br>&#x201c;Kindan!&#x201d; <br><br>Before he could even react to the sound of his name, the speaker pummeled into him, clutching him tightly about the waist and trying her best to squeeze the breath out of him. Brilliant sea- blue eyes looked out from behind a lock of rebellious honey- blond hair as the youngster turned her head and called back accusingly to the well- dressed Lord Holder behind her, &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t tell me he&#x2019;d be here!&#x201d; <br><br>Bemin of Fort Hold smiled indulgently at his daughter. &#x201c;There are such things as surprises, Fiona,&#x201d; he said with a wink. <br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Kindan, it&#x2019;s so good to see you!&#x201d; Fiona exclaimed, burying her face once more in Kindan&#x2019;s chest. <br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s good to see you, too,&#x201d; Kindan replied. He held out a hand to Fort Hold&#x2019;s Lord Holder. The older man, face lined with age and sad memories, took it in his own and gripped it tightly. <br><br>&#x201c;Good to see you again, lad,&#x201d; Bemin said. He looked up the stairs. &#x201c;I think we&#x2019;d better get up there or the dragons will all have hatched.&#x201d; <br><br>Fiona turned toward the steps, firmly locking her arms around Kindan&#x2019;s elbow. &#x201c;Harper Kindan,&#x201d; she said, sounding every inch a Lord Holder&#x2019;s daughter, &#x201c;would you do me the honor of escorting me?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;It would be my pleasure, Lady Fiona,&#x201d; Kindan replied with equal aplomb. A bronze fire- lizard darted down from the heights, alighted for a moment on Kindan&#x2019;s shoulder, chirped happily to him, then rose again in the air. <br><br>Lord Bemin chuckled. &#x201c;I see that Valla followed you.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t keep him away from a Hatching,&#x201d; Kindan confessed. He craned his neck up and scanned the swarm of fire- lizards over�head. &#x201c;Where are Jokester and Fire?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;We left them behind,&#x201d; Bemin said. &#x201c;I doubt either of them is as well- trained as yours.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Well, they&#x2019;ve barely two Turns out of the shell,&#x201d; Kindan allowed. &#x201c;Give them time.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Like all youngsters, they are impetuous and brash,&#x201d; Bemin agreed with a twinkle in his eyes. &#x201c;Why, you would not believe where I found my daughter&#x2013;&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Father!&#x201d; Fiona protested, a warm blush highlighting her freckles. Bemin laughed. <br><br>&#x201c;Chasing tunnel snakes again?&#x201d; Kindan asked her in a voice pitched for her ears alone. <br><br>He was not successful, as Bemin snorted, saying, &#x201c;I cannot teach her any decorum at all!&#x201d; He continued, &#x201c;She was hours in the bath and I&#x2019;m sure there&#x2019;s still dirt on her.&#x201d; <br><br>Kindan felt Fiona grab him tighter and heard her groan, but when he glanced down he saw the smile in her eyes. <br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s sounding much happier,&#x201d; he said quietly. <br><br>&#x201c;He deserves it,&#x201d; Fiona replied. <br><br>Kindan nodded in agreement. Lord Holder Bemin had kept his Hold together twelve Turns before when the Plague had struck and killed nearly one in four of his Holders, including his wife and all his children, save for the youngest, Fiona. <br><br>Kindan, sent from the Harper Hall to Fort Hold in disgrace after the fire, had helped Fort&#x2019;s old Healer, Kilti, to do everything pos�sible for the sick and dying. In the end, Kilti had succumbed to the Plague himself, leaving Kindan, at fourteen, in charge. <br><br>Fiona cocked her head at a change in the sound and then leapt up the steps, dragging Kindan along. &#x201c;Come on, they&#x2019;re hatching!&#x201d; <br><br>Indeed they were. Kindan, Fiona, and Bemin found seats saved for them next to Lord Itaral and his family. <br><br>&#x201c;Just some greens,&#x201d; Ilyssa assured Fiona as she patted the empty seat she&#x2019;d saved for her friend. Fiona relinquished her grip on Kindan with an apologetic look and happily took her place be�side Ilyssa. The two leaned toward each other and began to speak in low voices. <br><br>The hot sands rapidly filled with white- robed candidates, flown in by Fort Weyr&#x2019;s bronze dragons. The rest of Fort&#x2019;s dragons, perched high above, hummed in welcome, the sound growing louder as the eggs began to rock and crack. <br><br>Suddenly there was a hush as the first egg cracked open. A brown dragonet flopped out, awkward and creeling. A group of candidates darted anxiously around it&#x2013;some moving toward it, some away. And then&#x2013;one candidate reached out to the baby dragon and Impressed. The dragons hummed approvingly.<br>Another dragonet burst forth from its egg, and another, and another. From the stands, it seemed as though of tide of white- robed candidates flowed and ebbed around the blue, green, brown, and bronze dragonets until, finally, one white- robed figure stood pro�tectively beside each dragonet as the miracle of Impression was repeated. <br><br>&#x201c;Look there!&#x201d; Fiona called, pointing toward one of the larger eggs. &#x201c;Is that a queen?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;It could be,&#x201d; Kindan said. A great rent appeared in the shell, followed moments later by a golden head. &#x201c;It is!&#x201d; <br><br>The little queen made quick work of extricating herself from her egg while all around the bronzes crooned excitedly. Freed at last, the little gold queen walked around, looking from one candidate to another. <br><br>&#x201c;What would happen if there wasn&#x2019;t a suitable candidate?&#x201d; Fiona muttered to Kindan, who shrugged in response. The girls were trying; one bold girl just barely dodged the dragonet&#x2019;s awkward movements, pulled aside at the last moment by a shorter, younger, dark- haired girl. <br><br>Kentai had overheard the exchange. &#x201c;There are Records,&#x201d; he said, looking uncomfortable. <br><br>&#x201c;Well, she&#x2019;s coming this way,&#x201d; Ilyssa noted with excitement. <br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re near the exit to the Bowl,&#x201d; Kentai remarked. &#x201c;Maybe she&#x2019;s looking for someone out there.&#x201d; <br><br>She wasn&#x2019;t. Still ignoring the girls clustered around her, even the bold dark- haired one that Fiona would have thought she&#x2019;d like, the dragonet lurched over to the visitor stands. She looked up into the stands and creeled desperately. Kindan and Bemin exchanged alarmed looks as the little gold gazed toward Fiona. Fiona&#x2019;s eyes grew wide with shock and she glanced worriedly at Lord Bemin. Bemin seemed to wilt in despair&#x2013;Fiona was his last surviving child&#x2013;but he recovered and nodded weakly. <br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s her name?&#x201d; he asked his daughter, gesturing to the gold below and forcing his lips into a smile.<br> <br>The dragonet creeled again piteously and Fiona turned back to her, her face glowing in pure joy as she declared, &#x201c;She says her name is Talenth!&#x201d; <br><br>Kindan picked out K&#x2019;lior and Cisca climbing down the stairs toward them. It was obvious from the look on her face that Cisca had taken in the full import of the event. She would handle things from here. Kindan, who, after all, was beholden to Benden not Fort Weyr, turned away for a last look at the now empty Hatching Grounds. <br><br>For a moment, a very brief moment, before the egg had proved to be a gold, Kindan had imagined what might have happened if <i>he </i>had Impressed. A chirp from above distracted him as his fire-lizard, Valla, swooped down from his perch above, pleased with himself for locating Kindan and thrilled to have seen the Hatching. <br><br>Kindan shook himself from his reverie. He had been a miner, had bonded with a watch- wher, the dragons&#x2019; kin, and now he was a harper who had Impressed a fire- lizard. The Red Star was approaching, bringing the deadly Threads, and everything would change when the dragons began the fifty- Turn battle to save Pern from extinction. Vaguely Kindan wondered if he would live to see the end of the Pass and the return of the less trying times he had been born into. <br><br>The beating of a drum, the call to dinner, and a personal plea from Kentai for help in entertaining the revelers spurred Kindan up and out of the Hatching Grounds. At the entrance, he turned back once more, unable to contain his longing. <br><br>Kindan couldn&#x2019;t remember who waved him toward the sleeping quarters or quite how he got himself into bed. The evening had been a raucous celebration at which he had sung much, danced much, and drank much&#x2013;far more than his usual. He had no idea why he&#x2019;d drunk so much, nor why he&#x2019;d worked so hard that evening . . . until he woke in the middle of the night in a cold sweat. <br><br>The Weyr was silent, but the silence seemed more oppressive than comforting. The sound of his labored breathing came harshly to his ears and he sat up in his cot, glancing around nervously to check if his nightmare had disturbed anyone else to whom he&#x2019;d have to make a quick apology. <br><br>He heard no one. <br><br>In the distance a dragonet creeled uneasily. Then silence. <br><br>Kindan sighed and swung his legs over the side of the cot. <br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t as if he was the only one who had nightmares of the Plague, but he hadn&#x2019;t had many in the past several Turns, so he was surprised that he&#x2019;d had one now. Something about the day before must have reminded him subconsciously, so that he sang so hard and drank so much to keep away the pain. Not that it had worked, obviously. <br><br>The Plague that had swept across Pern and then&#x2013;just as quickly&#x2013;disappeared, had struck when he had only fourteen Turns, leaving him solely in charge of Fort Hold&#x2019;s sick when the aged healer had himself succumbed to the disease. So many had died. <br><br>So many, including Koriana, Lord Bemin&#x2019;s daughter and Fiona&#x2019;s older sister. <br><br>&#x201c;Koriana,&#x201d; Kindan whispered. The sound of her name brought both joy and pain, like a rose: pretty smell, prickly thorns. He shook his head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; <br><br><i>I tried, </i>he thought. But he wondered, as he always wondered: <i>Did I try hard enough? <br></i><br>Resolutely, Kindan lay back in the cot and closed his eyes. Presently, his breathing eased and he relaxed, but he did not sleep. And in that space between sleeping and waking, he heard the sound of a dragon departing <i>between. <br></i><br>Talenth&#x2019;s creel woke Fiona instantly. <br><br><i>What is it? </i>she asked, jumping out of her bed and rushing to the young queen&#x2019;s lair. <br><br><i>He hurts, </i>Talenth whimpered. Fiona knelt and pulled the young queen&#x2019;s head into her lap. <br><br><i>I&#x2019;m sorry, </i>she thought to her dragon, gently caressing the leathery hide. <br><br><i>He hurts and you feel it, </i>Talenth said. <i>How is it that you feel it? <br></i><br>Fiona furrowed her brow in surprise. At first she thought that Talenth was referring to her father, but then she forced herself to be honest. She had wheedled and whined her very best to con�vince her father to bring her to this Hatching, all because she knew that Kindan would be here. <br><br><i>I don&#x2019;t know, </i>she confessed. <i>I just do. I&#x2019;m sorry that it hurts you, too</i>.<br><br><i>Can you help him</i>?<br><br>Fiona bent to cradle Talenth&#x2019;s head with her whole body. <i>I&#x2019;m not</i> <i>sure, </i>she said. But deep inside her, Fiona knew that was a lie. As she considered it, she heard a noise&#x2013;a dragon going <i>between. <br></i><br><i>We&#x2019;ve been here long enough, let&#x2019;s go, </i>the rider thought to the dragon under her. <br><br><i>As you wish, </i>the dragon responded. With a great heave of its hind legs, the dragon leapt into the air and went <i>between. </i></p><h2>Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!: A Beginner&#39;s Guide</h2><p><p>It's all in the name: <i>Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</i> is a hilarious, illustrated guide to this complex functional language. Packed with the author's original artwork, pop culture references, and most importantly, useful example code, this book teaches functional fundamentals in a way you never thought possible.</p><p>You'll start with the kid stuff: basic syntax, recursion, types and type classes. Then once you've got the basics down, the real black belt master-class begins: you'll learn to use applicative functors, monads, zippers, and all the other mythical Haskell constructs you've only read about in storybooks.</p><p>As you work your way through the author's imaginative (and occasionally insane) examples, you'll learn to:</p> <ul><li>Laugh in the face of side effects as you wield purely functional programming techniques</li> <li>Use the magic of Haskell's "laziness" to play with infinite sets of data</li> <li>Organize your programs by creating your own types, type classes, and modules</li> <li>Use Haskell's elegant input/output system to share the genius of your programs with the outside world</li> </ul><p>Short of eating the author's brain, you will not find a better way to learn this powerful language than reading <i>Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</i></p> <strong>Excerpt from the Introduction</strong><p></p> <p><strong>Haskell is fun, and that&#x2019;s what it&#x2019;s all about!</strong></p> <p>This book is aimed at people who have experience programming in imperative languages&#x2014;such as C++, Java, and Python&#x2014;and now want to try out Haskell. But even if you don&#x2019;t have any significant programming experience, I&#x2019;ll bet a smart person like you will be able to follow along and learn Haskell.</p> <p>My first reaction to Haskell was that the language was just too weird. But after getting over that initial hurdle, it was smooth sailing. Even if Haskell seems strange to you at first, don&#x2019;t give up. Learning Haskell is almost like learning to program for the first time all over again. It&#x2019;s fun, and it forces you to think differently.</p> <p><strong>NOTE</strong><br> <i>If you ever get really stuck, the IRC channel</i> #haskell <i>on the freenode network is a great place to ask questions. The people there tend to be nice, patient, and understanding. They&#x2019;re a great resource for Haskell newbies.</i> </p><p><strong>So, What's Haskell?</strong></p> <table> <tbody><tr> <td></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Haskell is a <i>purely</i> functional programming language.</p> <p>In <i>imperative</i> programming languages, you give the computer a sequence of tasks, which it then executes. While executing them, the computer can change state. For instance, you can set the variable a to 5 and then do some stuff that might change the value of a. There are also flow-control structures for executing instructions several times, such as for and while loops.</p> <p>Purely functional programming is different. You don&#x2019;t tell the computer what to do&#x2014;you tell it what stuff is. For instance, you can tell the computer that the factorial of a number is the product of every integer from 1 to that number or that the sum of a list of numbers is the first number plus the sum of the remaining numbers. You can express both of these operations as functions.</p> <p>&gt; Read the Introduction (PDF) in its entirety.</p></p><p><b>Miran Lipova?a</b> is a computer science student in Ljubljana, Slovenia.

In the events of the preceding novel, the Pope commissioned Father Elijah to meet the President of the European Union, a man rising toward global control as President of the soon- to-be realized World Government. Recognizing in the President a resemblance to the anticipated Antichrist, the Pope asked Father Elijah to call the President to repentance, a mission that ended in failure.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In this sequel, now-Bishop Elijah, wanted for a murder he did not commit, tries again to meet the President. Accompanied by his fellow monk Brother Enoch, he enters Jerusalem just as the President arrives in the holy city to inaugurate a new stage of his rise to world power. This time Elijah hopes to unmask him as a spiritual danger to mankind. As the story unfolds, people of various backgrounds meet the fugitive priest, and in the encounter their souls are revealed and tested.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Elijah perseveres in his mission even when all seems lost. The dramatic climax is surprising, yet it underlines that God works all things to the good for those who love him.&nbsp;</p><p></p></p><p><p><b>Michael D.

A thrilling novel full of deep intelligence and spirituality, tenderness and beauty." --<strong>&nbsp;Astrid&nbsp;de Larminat</strong>, <em>Le Figaro</em> newspaper</p><h2>Buddha, Vol. 2: The Four Encounters</h2><p>Osamu Tezuka&#x2019;s vaunted storytelling genius, consummate skill at visual expression, and warm humanity blossom fully in his eight-volume epic of Siddhartha&#x2019;s life and times. Tezuka evidences his profound grasp of the subject by contextualizing the Buddha&#x2019;s ideas; the emphasis is on movement, action, emotion, and conflict as the prince Siddhartha runs away from home, travels across India, and questions Hindu practices such as ascetic self-mutilation and caste oppression. Rather than recommend resignation and impassivity, Tezuka&#x2019;s Buddha predicates enlightenment upon recognizing the interconnectedness of life, having compassion for the suffering, and ordering one&#x2019;s life sensibly. Philosophical segments are threaded into interpersonal situations with ground-breaking visual dynamism by an artist who makes sure never to lose his readers&#x2019; attention.<br><br>Tezuka himself was a humanist rather than a Buddhist, and his magnum opus is not an attempt at propaganda. Hermann Hesse&#x2019;s novel or Bertolucci&#x2019;s film is comparable in this regard; in fact, Tezuka&#x2019;s approach is slightly irreverent in that it incorporates something that Western commentators often eschew, namely, humor.</p><p>Osamu Tezuka (1928-89) is the godfather of Japanese manga comics. He originally intended to become a doctor and earned his degree before turning to what was then a medium for children. His many early masterpieces include the series known in the U.S. as <i>Astro Boy</i>. With his sweeping vision, deftly interwined plots, feel for the workings of power, and indefatigable commitment to human dignity, Tezuka elevated manga to an art form. The later Tezuka, when he authored Buddha, often had in mind the mature readership that manga gained in the sixties and that had only grown ever since. The Kurosawa of Japanese pop culture, Osamu Tezuka is a twentieth century classic."Infused with humor and history, the epic of Siddhartha is perhaps Osamu Tezuka's crowning acheivement and illustrates why, without irony, Tezuka is referred to as 'The King of Japanese Comics'." -<b><i> LA Weekly</i></b>"Buddha is one of Tezuka's true masterpieces. We're lucky to have this excellent new edition in English." - <b><i>Scott McCloud</i></b>, author of <i>Understanding Comics</i>"In handsome volumes designed by Chip Kidd, the Vertical books present Tezuka at his best." - <b><i>National Post<br></i></b><br>"<i>Buddha</i> is an engrossing tale. The armchair philosopher, the devout Buddhist, the casual manga fan - this book satisfies all with its tale of humanism through sequential art, and definitely earns its place on a bibliophile's bookshelf." -<b><i>Anime Insider</i></b>"This is one of the greatest acheivements of the comics medium, a masterpiece by one of the greats." -<b><i>Artbomb.net</i></b>"In Tezuka's world, the exquisite collapses into the goofy in a New York minute, the goofy into the melodramatic, the melodramatic into the brutal, and the brutal into the sincerely touching. The suprising result is a work wholly unique and downright fun." -<b><i>Time Out NY</i></b><i>"</i>Tezuka's Buddha is a striking and memorable confluence of ancient wisdom and contemporary popular art." -<b><i>Yoga Journal<br><br></i></b></p><h2>A Vietnam War Reader: A Documentary History from American and Vietnamese Perspectives</h2><p>An essential new resource for students and teachers of the Vietnam War, this concise collection of primary sources opens a valuable window on an extraordinarily complex conflict. <br><br>The materials gathered here, from both the American and Vietnamese sides, remind readers that the conflict touched the lives of many people in a wide range of social and political situations and spanned a good deal more time than the decade of direct U.S. combat.

Washington insiders broke rule after rule investigating the president, chasing a conspiracy that turned out not to exist. Somehow this was spun into Donald Trump having something to hide. People associated with the president were pushed into plea deals that had nothing to do with Russian &#x201c;collusion&#x201d; or discouraged from serving by the threat of huge legal bills. Somehow this was spun into Trump&#x2019;s lawyers being bullies. The president complained that the investigation was a waste of time, but he allowed it to continue unimpeded to the end. Somehow this was spun into obstruction of justice.<br> <br> In <em>Witch Hun</em><em>t</em>,&nbsp;Gregg Jarrett uncovers the bureaucratic malfeasance and malicious politicization of our country&#x2019;s justice system. The law was weaponized for partisan purposes. Even though it was Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s campaign that collected and disseminated a trove of lies about Trump from a former British spy and Russian operatives, Democrats and the media spun this into a claim that Trump was working for the Russians.<br> <br> Senior officials at the FBI, blinded by their political bias and hatred of Trump, went after the wrong person. At the DOJ, the deputy attorney general discussed secretly recording the president and recruiting members of the cabinet to depose Trump. Those behind the Witch Hunt have either been fired or resigned.&nbsp; Many of them are now under investigation for abuse of power. But what about the pundits who concocted wild narratives in real time on television, or the newspapers which covered the fact that rumors were being investigated without investigating the facts themselves?<br> <br> Factual, highly persuasive, and damning, this must-read expose makes clear that not only was there no &#x201c;collusion,&#x201d; but there was not even a basis for Mueller&#x2019;s investigation of the charge that has attacked Trump and his administration for more than two years.

Brought up in a household of learning and privilege, she is unaware of her difference until she overhears a conversation that suddenly makes her conscious of her race--and of the prejudice it arouses. From this point on, Ourika lives her life not as a French woman but as a black woman who feels "cut off from the entire human race." As the Reign of Terror threatens her and her adoptive family, Ourika struggles with her unusual position as an educated African woman in eighteenth-century Europe.</p><p>A best-seller in the 1820s, <em>Ourika</em> captured the attention of Duras's peers, including Stendhal, and became the subject of four contemporary plays.

In this new book, Small outlines a theory of what he terms "musicking," a verb that encompasses all musical activity from composing to performing to listening to a Walkman to singing in the shower. <br><br>Using Gregory Bateson's philosophy of mind and a Geertzian thick description of a typical concert in a typical symphony hall, Small demonstrates how musicking forms a ritual through which all the participants explore and celebrate the relationships that constitute their social identity.

Faithful to Catholic teaching yet critical, discerning yet impartial, Nichols offers this introduction to dogmatic theology, with the firm belief that dogmatics are the center of theology, and that any theological discipline which cuts itself off from these heartlands does so at its own peril. For it is in dogmatics that theology is in touch with the heart of revelation, and only by virtue of the quality of its contact with that revelation is thinking Christian at all.</p> <p>Though comprehensive and far-reaching, this work is not beyond the understanding of people just commencing a study of theology. It makes an excellent text for study groups.</p></p><p>Fr. Aidan Nichols, O.P., of Blackfriars, Cambridge, is a lecturer at Cambridge University. He was awarded the title Sacrae Theologiae Magister by the Dominican order in 2003. His many important works include <i>The Shape of Catholic Theology: An Introduction to its Sources, Principles and History; Epiphany: A Theological Introduction to Catholicism; Lovely, like Jerusalem: The Fulfillment of the Old Testament in Christ and the Church; The Thought of Pope Benedict XVI: An Introduction to the Theology of Joseph Ratzinger</i>; and, most recently, <i>Lost in Wonder: Essays on Liturgy and the Arts.</i>This is a sound introduction to the doing of Catholic theology designed for use by the theological student but entirely accessible to the general educated reader. <i>ADRIS</i></p><h2>Gifts from a Course in Miracles: Accept This Gift, A Gift of Peace, A Gift of Healing</h2><p>The philosophical depth, psychological insight, and spiritual guidance of <b>A Course in Miracles</b> have been an extraordinary treasure of wisdom for millions of readers worldwide since its original publication in 1976.

That's part of what makes Brian Wilson's story so astonishing.<br><br>As a cofounding member of the Beach Boys in the 1960s, Wilson created some of the most groundbreaking and timeless popular music ever recorded. With intricate harmonies, symphonic structures, and wide-eyed lyrics that explored life's most transcendent joys and deepest sorrows, songs like "In My Room," "God Only Knows," and "Good Vibrations" forever expanded the possibilities of pop songwriting. Derailed in the 1970s by mental illness, drug use, and the shifting fortunes of the band, Wilson came back again and again over the next few decades, surviving and-finally-thriving. Now, for the first time, he weighs in on the sources of his creative inspiration and on his struggles, the exhilarating highs and the debilitating lows.<br><br><i>I Am Brian Wilson</i> reveals as never before the man who fought his way back to stability and creative relevance, who became a mesmerizing live artist, who forced himself to reckon with his own complex legacy, and who finally completed <i>Smile</i>, the legendary unfinished Beach Boys record that had become synonymous with both his genius and its destabilization. Today Brian Wilson is older, calmer, and filled with perspective and forgiveness. Whether he's talking about his childhood, his bandmates, or his own inner demons, Wilson's story, told in his own voice and in his own way, unforgettably illuminates the man behind the music, working through the turbulence and discord to achieve, at last, a new harmony.<br></p><p><b>Brian Wilson</b>, best known for his work with the Beach Boys, is one of popular music's most revered figures. The main creative force behind some of the most cherished recordings in rock history and one of the most influential composers of the last century, Wilson became a Kennedy Center Honoree in 2007.

Other people can talk about my life. Sometimes they&#x2019;ll get it right and sometimes they&#x2019;ll get it wrong. For me, when I think back across my own life, there are so many things that are painful. Sometimes I don&#x2019;t like discussing them. Sometimes I don&#x2019;t even like remembering them.<br><br>But as I get older, the shape of that pain has changed. Sometimes memories come back to me when I least expect them. Maybe that&#x2019;s the only way it works when you&#x2019;ve lived the life I&#x2019;ve lived: starting a band with my brothers that was managed by my father, watching my father become difficult and then impossible, watching myself become difficult and then impossible, watching women I loved come and go, watching children come into the world, watching my brothers get older, watching them pass out of the world. Some of those things shaped me. Others scarred me.<br><br>Sometimes it was hard to tell the difference. When I watched my father fly into a rage and take swings at me and my brothers, was that shaping or scarring? When we watched him grow frustrated with his day job and take solace in music, was that shaping or scarring? Those are all memories but I can&#x2019;t get to them all at once. I&#x2019;ve had a whole lifetime to take them in. Now I have a whole book to put them out there.</p><h2>Robert E.
